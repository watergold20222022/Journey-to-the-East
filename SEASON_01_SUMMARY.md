## Key Story Arcs

### 1. The Fall of the Great Sage (Chapters 1-5)
The story opens with Sun Wukong suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of Red Boy, who wields the high-tech Samadhi Fire. Red Boy's attack creates a "Samadhi Vortex," a singularity that tears the fabric of space-time.
*   **The Consequence:** The pilgrims (Tang Seng, Bajie, Sha Seng) are sucked into the vortex and lost.
*   **The Exile:** Wukong is healed by a high-tech Guanyin Bodhisattva but is left aimless. He travels to Planet Kunlun seeking answers from the creator goddess Nuwa, only to be told he must find his "original self."

### 2. The Pig's Redemption (Chapters 6-18)
The narrative shifts to Zhu Bajie, who lands on **Planet Kara**, a world ruled by genetically modified Beast-Men who despise humans. Stripped of his powers and weapons, Bajie must survive as a bottom-feeder in the sewers.
*   **The Rise:** Bajie befriends Alice (a fox thief) and Tybalt (a tiger mercenary). He rises through the ranks of the oppressed, eventually joining the military defense force.
*   **The Hero:** When an ancient Human AI Fleet (the "Silicon Legion") returns to wipe out the Beast-Men, Bajie reveals his true nature. He saves the planet, destroys the AI core, and becomes a celebrated General and hero.
*   **The Discovery:** Deep in the planet's core, Bajie discovers the *Ruyi Jingu Bang* (Golden Staff), a relic that shouldn't be there, humming with a signal.

### 3. The Cosmic Search (Chapters 19-21)
Using the resonance of the Golden Staff and the Master's Diary, Bajie's team (included Alice and a repurposed robot named **Tianji**) pinpoints Wukong's signal.
*   **The Mission:** Bajie mobilizes the resources of Planet Kara to refit a human warship, the *Sky Rake*, for an interstellar rescue mission.
*   **The Team:** The trio of Bajie (Biological Power), Alice (Human Ingenuity), and Tianji (Artificial Intelligence) forms the core of the new pilgrimage.

### 4. The Multiverse Reunion (Chapters 22-26)
The team arrives at Planet Kunlun but cannot see Wukong, though they can sense him. Tianji reveals the truth: they are in different locations on the **Multiverse Tree**.
*   **The Breakthrough:** Using massive computing power, they tear a hole in the timeline, bridging the gap between Bajie's reality and Wukong's desolate prison.
*   **The Twin Staffs:** When they reunite, Bajie presents the staff he found on Kara. Wukong reveals he *already* has his staff. The existence of two real Golden Staffs confirms the Multiverse theory: they were scattered across parallel dimensions.
*   **The Crisis:** The season ends with Wukong realizing the terrifying scale of their problem. If there are infinite universes, there are infinite Buddhas and infinite Masters. The search for *their* specific Tang Seng is statistically impossible, leading to a profound crisis of faith.
