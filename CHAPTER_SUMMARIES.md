Guanyin reveals that Red Boy’s final attack created a "Samadhi vortex"—a chaotic wormhole that scattered the other pilgrims across the multiverse. Guanyin refuses to give Wukong their exact locations, explaining that the vortex was non-deterministic. Instead, she tasks him with a new journey of discovery.

Wukong descends into the high-gravity core, defeats the "Corrupted Echoes," and retrieves the gem. Upon receiving the stone, Nuwa gives him a cryptic revelation: to find the Master, he must first find his "original self" (初心). She then disappears, leaving Wukong in a state of profound confusion.
