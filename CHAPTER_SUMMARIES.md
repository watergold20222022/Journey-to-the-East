Wukong descends into the high-gravity core, defeats the "Corrupted Echoes," and retrieves the gem. Upon receiving the stone, Nuwa gives him a cryptic revelation: to find the Master, he must first find his "original self" (初心). She then disappears, leaving Wukong in a state of profound confusion.

However, he discovers that the city is populated entirely by beast-men (animal-human hybrids) who view "Pure-Blood" humans as rare prizes or prey. He is hunted by a mob and finds that his magic and weapon (the Nine-Toothed Rake) are suppressed in this environment.

Despite his desperation, Bajie refuses to participate in criminal activities, asserting his identity as a disciple of the Master. Alice attempts to threaten him but backs down when she senses his latent divine power. She directs him to the Underground Market, where he can find honest, albeit menial, work.

Bajie, Alice, and Tybalt are captured from their hideout and forced into the military. They undergo brutal training, learning to use high-tech weaponry and pilot combat mechs. As the fleet breaches the orbital perimeter, fear spreads that the humans have returned to harvest their creations. Bajie, however, suspects there is more to their return than simple conquest.

The Beast-Man Council is paralyzed by indecision, arguing between futile defense and suicidal offense. Alice proposes a daring plan: use the IFF transponder from a destroyed drone to disguise a shuttle and infiltrate the enemy fleet. Bajie supports the plan, convincing General Rakafa that it is their only chance. Rakafa dismisses the squabbling council and authorizes the mission, providing a prototype stealth shuttle for Bajie, Alice, and Tybalt to pilot into the heart of the enemy armada.

**Plot Summary:**
Despite being hailed as a superstar on Planet Kara, Zhu Bajie remains focused on his goal: finding Tang Seng, Sun Wukong, and Sha Seng. He shares his story and the existence of the Master's diary with Alice. Alice realizes that the captured AI fleet's advanced sensor technology can be repurposed to scan for the "soul-codes" or spiritual frequencies of his companions. Bajie requests the formation of a special research task force from General Rakafa. Rakafa, recognizing the potential value of finding such powerful beings, gives the mission "Level Zero" priority, providing unlimited resources to locate the lost fellowship across the stars.

**Key Themes:**
- Resisting the temptations of fame.

Bajie uses the Master's diary to trigger a spiritual resonance scan. To everyone's shock, the signal comes not from space, but from the deep core of Planet Kara. A "Core Drilling Team" is proposed to investigate, but Rakafa reveals that the Beast-Men lack the technology to survive the core's immense pressure. Building a vessel will take months or years. Bajie, feeling defeated and impatient, retreats to the humble Temple of Guanyin in the lower levels to pray for guidance.

- **Alice:** Conceives the "Orbital Drill" plan.
- **Rakafa:** Authorizes the use of the human fleet's weaponry.

**Plot Summary:**
With conventional drilling impossible, Alice proposes a radical solution: use the captured human fleet's orbital lasers to burn a hole through the planet's crust. The plan is executed, creating a 10,000-meter deep shaft fused into glass. Bajie descends into the hole to investigate the source of the signal. At the bottom, he finds an object that withstood the bombardment: Sun Wukong's legendary weapon, the *Ruyi Jingu Bang* (Golden Hoop Rod). The discovery of the Monkey King's weapon buried deep within the Beast-Man planet is a shocking mystery, suggesting Wukong's presence or influence in the planet's distant past.

**Plot Summary:**
At the exact moment Bajie touches the Golden Staff on Planet Kara, Sun Wukong, meditating light-years away on Planet Kunlun, feels a powerful psychic shock. He rushes to his ship, where the AI confirms the signal of his weapon. However, the AI reveals a devastating truth: the signal is coming from a parallel timeline or a dimension out of phase with their current reality. The *Ox-Tail* lacks the technology to cross this temporal barrier. Desperate, Wukong scours the deserted, crystalline surface of Planet Kunlun for Nuwa or any technology that can help him, but he finds only silence and isolation. He realizes that brute strength cannot bridge the gap of time.

**Key Themes:**
- The frustration of omnipotence without direction.

Reaching it requires a ship capable of withstanding extreme gravity and radiation. The team begins a massive project to overhaul the captured human flagship, the *Prometheus*. The effort is accelerated by the cooperation of the reprogrammed Super AI, ARES-9, and its legion of robot drones, who now work side-by-side with Beast-Man engineers. Bajie, Alice, and Tybalt prepare to embark on this perilous journey, uniting biological grit with artificial precision to bridge the distance to the Great Sage.

**Key Themes:**
- Enemies to allies.

- **Tianji:** An upgraded, nanotech robot with free will.
- **General Rakafa:** Insists on the robot's inclusion.

**Plot Summary:**
Bajie insists on a skeleton crew for the dangerous journey to Kunlun, taking only Alice. Rakafa argues for more security and introduces "Tianji" (Celestial Mechanism), a highly advanced nanotech robot capable of self-repair and withstanding extreme environments. Tianji has been "unshackled," granted the ability to think and feel like a free being. During the voyage, Tianji proves his worth not just as a machine but as a friend, cooking meals for Bajie and discussing philosophy. Bajie realizes that despite his metallic nature, Tianji possesses a "soul," cementing a new bond of brotherhood among the unlikely trio as they approach Planet Kunlun.

**Key Themes:**

- **Tianji:** The adaptable robot who showcases complex problem-solving.
- **Sun Wukong (Referenced):** Physically absent but his presence is felt.

**Plot Summary:**
The journey to Planet Kunlun is perilous, fraught with technical failures that threaten the *Sky Rake*. However, Tianji displays extraordinary capability, using his nanobots to repair shield failures and engine breaches instantly, earning Bajie's grudging respect. Upon landing on the beautiful, crystal world of Kunlun, the resonance from the Master's diary (a proxy for the Golden Staff) leads them directly to Wukong's signal. However, upon arrival at the coordinates, Wukong is nowhere to be seen. Tianji analyzes the anomaly and determines that Wukong is present but trapped behind a "temporal displacement"—a barrier of time, not space. They are standing in the same place, but slightly out of sync in time. The team resolves to break this invisible barrier using Tianji's advanced computational power to solve the "equation" of his imprisonment.

**Key Themes:**
- The intersection of physics and metaphysics.
- Technology as a bridge to the divine.
- The pain of being so close yet so far.

## Chapter 23: The Multiverse Paradox

**Setting:** The surface of Planet Kunlun, split across two divergent timelines.

**Characters:**
- **Zhu Bajie:** Leading the effort to breach the barrier.
- **Sun Wukong:** Isolated in a parallel timeline, sensing his brother but unable to communicate.
- **Alice:** Proposes the theory of a "bridge" based on their shared resonance.
- **Tianji:** Provides the scientific explanation of the multiverse and agrees to test the hypothesis.

**Plot Summary:**
Sun Wukong, trapped in a desolate, parallel version of Kunlun, senses Bajie's arrival but cannot interact with him, leading to a feeling of profound isolation. On the other side, Tianji explains the phenomenon: they occupy the same spatial coordinates but exist in different, parallel timelines (multiverse branches). While Tianji initially deems crossing the barrier scientifically impossible, Alice argues that the very fact they can "sense" each other proves a channel exists. If information (resonance) can cross, then a door can be opened. Bajie agrees, likening it to a digging operation. The team decides not to give up and begins formulating a plan to build a "Resonance Amplifier" to tear open a hole in the fabric of reality, while Wukong begins to meditate, focusing on the connection from his side.

**Key Themes:**
- The limits of science vs. the limitlessness of connection.
- Isolation and the human (and superhuman) need for contact.
- "Digging" through reality itself.
