The presence of two identical, authentic Divine Iron artifacts confuses the group until Tianji provides an explanation: the Multiverse. They realize that Red Boy's attack scattered them not just across space, but across different branches of reality. Planet Kara exists in a universe where the staff was lost; this Kunlun exists in one where Wukong kept it. The realization that there are infinite versions of themselves and their loved ones causes a moment of existential dread for Bajie. However, Wukong rejects this nihilism. He asserts that their specific bonds, memories, and their specific Master are unique to *them*, and valid regardless of the multiverse configuration. Empowered by this resolve (and now wielding two Golden Staffs), Wukong prepares the team for the next phase of the search.

**Key Themes:**

Realizing that finding their specific version of Tang Seng in an infinite multiverse is statistically impossible without a guide, the team decides to retreat to Planet Kara to regroup. Upon their return, Wukong witnesses the hero's welcome Bajie receives. He is genuinely impressed by how much his "lazy" junior brother has grown, acknowledging him as a true warrior and savior. However, the mood shifts during a quiet moment at night. Wukong confesses a terrifying realization: if the multiverse exists, there must be infinite versions of the Buddha and Guanyin Bodhisattva. This concept of "commodity gods" strips away the sanctity of their previous journey and belief system, leaving Wukong with a chilling sense of emptiness. He wonders if anything—divinity, enlightenment, or purpose—is truly unique.

Unable to fly due to atmospheric turbulence, the team proceeds on foot into the frozen Northern Wastes. The environment is brutal, with temperatures dropping below -80°C and a landscape of razor-sharp ice spires. They are ambushed by a pack of "Snow Stalkers"—gigantic six-limbed predators with chitinous armor. A chaotic battle ensues. Alice finds her energy weapons ineffective, but Wukong and Bajie use brute force to subdue the beasts, while Tianji analyzes their weaknesses (vibration sensitivity). Wukong realizes the behavior of the beasts is unnatural; they were acting as guards. Pressing on through the storm without finding the staff, they eventually spot a massive, unnatural structure in the distance: a glowing green pyramid of ice, presumably the thief's lair.

**Key Themes:**
- Man/Monkey/Pig vs. Nature.
- The hostility of the unknown.
- Signs of intelligent design in the wilderness.

## Chapter 29: The Mutated Guardians

**Setting:** The exterior and entrance of the Green Ice Pyramid (Northern Wastes).

**Characters:**
- **Sun Wukong:** Uses clones and immense strength to decimate the monster horde.
- **Zhu Bajie:** Battles the heavy "tank" monsters.
- **Tianji:** Performs the autopsy and genetic analysis.
- **Mutated Fauna:** Frost-Winged Shriekers (Owl/Eagle), Tusked Behemoths (Walrus), Shadow Biters (Fox).

**Plot Summary:**
Wukong "knocks" on the pyramid, triggering a massive defensive response. Hundreds of mutated arctic creatures burst forth to attack the team. A fierce battle ensues. Wukong counters the sonic attacks of the "Frost-Winged Shriekers" and uses his hair-clones to handle the swarming "Shadow Biters." Bajie proves his strength by wrestling the massive, tank-like "Tusked Behemoths." Alice provides covering fire. After the victory, Tianji analyzes the corpses. He discovers that these are not natural demons or engineered cyborgs, but local wildlife whose DNA was rewritten by a "brute force" energy source, causing rapid, painful mutation and accelerated aging. Wukong recognizes this as a form of dark magic (sorcery) used by ancient Demon Kings to create disposable armies. He condemns this "corruption of the Dao" and leads the team into the pyramid to face the master of this twisted creation.

**Key Themes:**
- The perversion of life for power.
- Science analyzing Magic.

- **Tianji:** Identifies the mutagen in Sha Seng's system.

**Plot Summary:**
Penetrating the heart of the pyramid, Wukong finds the stolen Golden Staff suspended in an anti-gravity field. Guarding it is a terrifying figure: Sha Wujing. However, this version of Sha Seng is twisted—skin the color of a bruised glacier, wild red hair, and eyes burning with green madness. When Wukong tries to talk to him, Sha Seng attacks viciously, wielding a plasma-charged Crescent Moon Spade and screaming that Wukong is a demon impostor. Wukong, recognizing his "Little Brother," spends the fight dodging and parrying, unable to bring himself to hurt him. Seeing Wukong in danger, Bajie steps in with a gravity attack, pinning Sha Seng so Alice can restrain him. Even captured, Sha Seng raves about "purging the unclean" and protecting the relic. Tianji confirms he is infected with the same mutagen as the beasts. In a moment of lucidity, Sha Seng warns that "The Bone Lady comes."

**Plot Summary:**
After being sedated and treated by Tianji, Sha Seng regains lucidity but is haunted by grief. He recounts the horrific day his team fell to Baigujing. In this timeline, the White Bone Demon used a nano-swarm disguised as clouds to strip the flesh from Sun Wukong's bones instantly. Bajie died heroically but gruesomely, lured into a trap by the Master's mimicked voice and drained of his marrow over three days. Sha Seng, deemed "too tough" to eat, was enslaved and mutated to guard Baigujing's trophies—including the dead Wukong's Golden Staff. He reveals that Tang Seng is still alive, kept as a "blood bag" to feed Baigujing's immortality. Wukong and Bajie realize they are facing a multiverse variant of their old enemy who has already won. They choose not to explain the complex physics to the traumatized Sha Seng, instead promising to avenge his brothers and rescue the Master. Wukong declares that Baigujing is about to learn that "ghosts can bite back."

They first encounter "Bone Crawlers"—reanimated skeletal leviathans—which they dispatch with heavy strikes and plasma fire. As they advance, they face "Ice Golems" that reform until melted by Tianji's flamethrowers, and "Valkyrie Harpies" that Bajie engages in aerial combat. Throughout the fight, Wukong feels the signal of the stolen staff intensifying, along with a faint biological heartbeat that confirms the Master of this timeline is still alive.

The trio breaches the sanctum to find Baigujing seated on a throne of fused skulls, with the stolen Golden Staff and the comatose Master displayed as trophies. She mocks them, revealing her control over the entire bone tower. She animates the room itself, trapping Wukong in crushing walls of rib-cages. Tianji intervenes, activating "Protocol: Divine Deconstruction." He unleashes a swarm of nanobots that don't just break the bone but disassemble it at the atomic level, rewriting the reality of her fortress. The "silver tide" neutralizes her defenses and strips her armor, terrifying the demon who mistakes it for high-level magic. With her defenses crumbled by the robot, Bajie clears a path, and Wukong delivers the finishing blow, shattering her cybernetic skull. Baigujing falls, her immortality stripped away by superior engineering. Wukong reclaims the second staff, and the team secures the room.

- **Zhu Bajie:** Realizes his role in bringing the staff back to surface.

**Plot Summary:**
Baigujing, defeated and stripped of her power, expresses disbelief that Wukong and Bajie are alive, having personally killed and consumed them in this timeline. Wukong explains the nature of the multiverse. Baigujing shares her memory of the "Battle of White Tiger Ridge" from centuries ago. She reveals that she defeated the native Wukong not by strength, but by using a molecular-destabilizing trap and a nano-swarm to strip his flesh instantly. However, during his death, the Golden Staff fell into a deep planetary fissure and was lost in the core, beyond her reach. When Bajie recovered the staff in the previous season and brought it to the surface, Baigujing felt its resonance. Fearing that Wukong had returned from the grave, she used her cybernetically enhanced speed ("overclocking") to infiltrate the Defense HQ and steal it, hoping to destroy the relic and her fear forever. Wukong realizes the tragedy of his alternate self and decides to hand Baigujing's fate over to the timeline's survivor, Sha Seng.

- The paranoia of the usurper.
- The persistence of heavy objects (and history).
- Justice transferred to the victim.
