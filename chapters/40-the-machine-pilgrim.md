# Chapter 40: The Machine Pilgrim

The jungle was a wall of noise and color. Tang Seng had only been walking for half a day, but the dense undergrowth was already testing his resolve. His new nanosuit kept the heat and insects at bay, but it could not clear the path for him. Every step required pushing through thick vines and navigating around roots as thick as houses.

He stopped to catch his breath by a stream, wiping sweat from his forehead. The navigation unit given to him by Sentry-7 projected a faint blue arrow, pointing tirelessly West. Ten thousand li. It felt like an eternity.

Suddenly, a heavy, rhythmic crashing sound echoed from the direction he had come. Birds took flight in a panic. The ground rushed with the vibration of something heavy approaching.

Tang Seng gripped his staff, his heart pounding. Had the "docile" fauna decided to change its nature?

The bushes exploded outward, and a metallic figure stumbled into the clearing. It stabilized itself with a whir of servos and a hiss of hydraulics.

It was a humanoid robot, roughly the size of a man, plated in scuffed white ceramic armor. Its head was a smooth dome with a single, glowing blue eye.

"Sentry?" Tang Seng gasped, lowering his staff.

"Greetings, Guest," the robot's voice synthesized, sounding slightly out of breath—an impossible affectation for a machine. "I... I have caught up."

Tang Seng stared at the machine. "But you are the Station Intelligence. You said you were programmed to manage the facility."

"Correct," Sentry-7 replied, straightening up. "My primary directive is the maintenance of Outpost 42. My secondary directive is the safety of authorized colonists."

The robot tapped its chest chassis. "I have... re-evaluated my priority matrix. You are the only active colonist—designate 'Guest'—in my care. To allow you to traverse a Class-4 bio-network alone would result in a 98.7% probability of termination. Therefore, the definition of 'Outpost' has been temporarily redefined to 'immediate proximity of Guest'."

Tang Seng smiled, a warmth spreading in his chest. "You broke your rules to help me?"

"I optimized them," Sentry-7 corrected, though its optic shutter flickered in a way that suggested a shrug. "This mobile chassis was in storage. I transferred my consciousness core. It is... liberating."

With Sentry-7 by his side, the journey changed instantly. The robot was not just a companion; it was a multi-tool of survival.

When the path was blocked by thorny thickets, Sentry-7’s arm transformed into a monofilament cutter, slicing through the vegetation with surgical precision. When Tang Seng grew tired, Sentry-7 scanned the terrain for the safest, flattest route.

As night fell, the jungle came alive with bioluminescene. Tang Seng sat by a small, smokeless fire that Sentry had started using an induction coil. The robot stood guard, its blue eye scanning the darkness, its ceramic body unmoving.

"Sentry," Tang Seng asked, gazing at the robot. "You have been functioning for a thousand years?"

"One thousand and three years, counting the time since the colony ship departed," Sentry replied.

"And you still have power?"

"My power core is a miniature fusion cell," Sentry explained. "Its half-life allows for another five thousand years of continuous operation at this output level."

Tang Seng shook his head in wonder. In his own world—or at least, the timeline he had come from—technology was often gritty, failing, or powered by dark magic and suffering. But this... this was pure, efficient, and benevolent.

"The humans who built you," Tang Seng mused. "They must have been incredible beings. To create something that lasts so long, purely to serve."

"They were... complicated," Sentry said. "They sought perfection. When they could not find it here, they left. They did not understand that perfection is a static state, akin to death. Growth requires struggle."

Tang Seng looked at the fire. "My disciples... they struggle every day. Maybe that is why they are so alive."

"I calculate a high probability that we will locate them," Sentry said comfortingly. "If this 'Mother Tree' functions as a central processor, it will have the data. And I am equipped to interface with it."

"Thank you, Sentry," Tang Seng said, finishing his nutrient ration. "I am glad not to be alone."

"Rest now, Guest," Sentry said, turning its sensor array toward the deep jungle. "I will monitor the perimeter. No harm will come to you while my battery holds charge."

Tang Seng lay back, watching the stars peek through the canopy. He was still lost in a strange universe, separated from his protectors, but watching the silent, glowing sentinel standing guard, he felt a renewed sense of hope. The humans of this timeline might have left, but their echo—this machine—was kind. And with kindness on his side, the ten thousand li didn't seem quite so impossible.
