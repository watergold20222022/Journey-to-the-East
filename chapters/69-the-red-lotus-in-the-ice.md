# Chapter 69: The Red Lotus in the Ice

Planet Cryos-4 was a world of absolute zero. Even the atmosphere had frozen, falling as nitrogen snow that crunched underfoot like broken glass.

The Ice Demon—a towering construct of jagged glacial shards and cryo-hydraulics—roared. It swung a hammer made of a frozen asteroid, aiming to flatten the small figure standing in the snow.

The figure didn't move. He didn't even look up.

He was a young man, handsome and terrifyingly perfect, like a porcelain doll brought to life by war. He wore the battle armor of the Heavenly Court's Elite Vanguard: red and gold, humming with thermal shielding. Around his shoulders draped the Armillary Sash—a ribbon of red nanotechnology that floated with a mind of its own.

"Target lock," Nezha whispered, bored.

The hammer crashed down.

At the moment of impact, Nezha stepped sideways. Not a dodge, just a shift in coordinates. The hammer smashed into the ice, sending a shockwave that shattered glaciers miles away.

Nezha stood on the hammer's head, looking down at the beast.

"Is that it?" Nezha asked. "I traveled twelve parsecs for this?"

The Ice Demon snarled and activated its chest cannons. Beams of absolute cold shot upward.

Nezha's eyes—burning with eternal fusion fire—flared.

"Wind Fire Wheels: Ignite."

Two rings of fire materialized under his boots. They weren't just thrusters; they were singularity engines. Nezha kicked off the hammer, spinning into a blur of red light.

He became a saw blade of thermal energy. He sliced through the freezing beams, through the hammer, and through the demon's torso in a single heartbeat.

He landed gracefully behind the creature.

*CRACK.*

The Ice Demon split perfectly down the middle. The two halves slid apart, the edges glowing molten orange from the heat of the cut.

"Threat eliminated," Nezha said, checking his manicured fingernails. "Time elapsed: 14 seconds. Disappointing."

He summoned his Fire-tipped Spear, twirling it idly. The heat from the weapon sublimated the snow around him, creating a personal circle of steam.

"Third Prince," his AI command interface chimed. "Incoming transmission. Priority: Alpha-One."

"Alpha-One?" Nezha raised an eyebrow. That code belonged to the High Council. Or higher. "Patch it through."

A holographic projection flickered into existence amidst the steam. It was a figure seated on a lotus throne, bathed in serene white light.

"Bodhisattva," Nezha bowed slightly—a warrior's bow, concise and respectful, but not servile. "To what do I owe the honor? Did another monkey fall out of a stone?"

"Something worse, Marshall," Guanyin's voice was calm, but there was a tension in the data stream. "A breach in the Eternal Hell."

Nezha paused. "The Null Dimension? Impossible. Nothing escapes entropy."

"Everything breaks eventually," Guanyin said. "The prisoner Red Boy has escaped. He has acquired... outside assistance. Void capabilities."

"The kid with the fire?" Nezha smirked. "Cute. I heard he gave the Monkey a hard time."

"He defeated the Monkey," Guanyin corrected. "And now he is hunting him. Wukong has been rebooted, Nezha. He is vulnerable. If Red Boy finds him, the Journey ends."

"And you want me to play babysitter?" Nezha scowled. "I am a God of War, not a bodyguard."

"I want you to hunt," Guanyin said. "Red Boy has corrupted the Samadhi Fire with Void energy. He is a threat to the stability of the sector. Apprehend him. If he resists... burn him."

Nezha gripped his spear tighter. A threat that could break out of the Eternal Hell? A child who had beaten the Monkey King?

The boredom that had plagued him for centuries began to melt away.

"Coordinates?" Nezha asked, a cruel smile spreading across his face.

"He was last tracked heading for Kunlun," Guanyin replied.

"Consider it done," Nezha said. "I'll bring you his head. Or a very good excuse."

The hologram faded.

Nezha looked at the dead Ice Demon. He kicked the frozen carcass, shattering it into a million pieces.

"Finally," he whispered, igniting his wheels. "A real game."
