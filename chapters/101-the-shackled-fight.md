# Chapter 101: The Shackled Fight

They hit the atmosphere burning. The friction was intense, but Wukong didn't slow down. He and Bajie (in his mechanized heavy-lifter exosuit) smashed into a rocky plateau, creating a crater.

The Void Kraken roared. It was a sound felt in the teeth, a low-frequency rumble that shattered rocks. A tentacle as wide as a highway slammed down right where they landed.

"Dodge!" Wukong shoved Bajie aside.

The tentacle missed them but pulverized the ground. Liquid magma sprayed up from the wound.

Wukong leaped onto the tentacle, running up its length. He raised the Dragon Tooth Staff. The white blade hummed, hungry for blood.

"Take this!" Wukong swung.

The staff sliced through the thick, rubbery hide like it was smoke. Purple ichor sprayed out, sizzling on the ground. The Kraken shrieked.

"Yeah! Get him!" Bajie cheered, firing rockets from his shoulder pods.

But Wukong stopped.

Through the gap he just cut, he saw the Kraken's inner biology. It wasn't just flesh. Fused into its nervous system were massive, glowing roots that went deep underground, wrapping around the planet's very core.

"Tianji!" Wukong yelled into his comms. "Scan the roots!"

"Do not sever them!" Tianji's voice was frantic. "The Kraken has integrated its vascular system with the planet's mantle. If you kill it instantly, the pressure release will cause the core to detonate. The planet will explode."

"So I can't kill it?" Wukong dodged another tentacle. "Great! Just great!"

"You have to surgically remove it," Tianji said. "Uncouple the roots one by one. It will take time."

"Time is the one thing we don't have!" Bajie looked up. The sky was getting darker. The black hole was pulling them closer.

The Kraken seemed to realize their hesitation. It stopped flailing and started maneuvering. It used its tentacles not to strike, but to shield its vital spots. And worse, it started using hostages.

It ripped the roof off a nearby cave system, exposing hundreds of the ape-creatures. It hovered a massive, spiked tentacle over them.

"It's bargaining," Bajie gasped. "Smart squid."

Wukong gritted his teeth. He landed on a ridge, staff held low. He couldn't unleash a shockwave. He couldn't use his giant form. He was the most powerful warrior in the galaxy, and he was completely handcuffed.

"Fine," Wukong growled. "We do it the hard way."

He tossed the staff to his left hand.

"Bajie! Shield the monkeys! I'm going in close!"

Wukong charged. He abandoned his grand, sweeping attacks for precise, brutal martial arts. He punched the Kraken's eyes, kicked its sensory nodes, tore at its flesh with his bare hands. He was trying to annoy it, to make it lose focus and release the planet.

It worked. The Kraken roared in annoyance and focused all its attention on the golden gnat buzzing around its face.

It lashed out with all thousand tentacles, weaving a cage of flesh and void energy.

"Gotcha," Wukong grinned. He was luring it away from the ground.

But he forgot about the gravity.

As he jumped, the black hole's tidal force surged. His trajectory was warped. He missed his landing.

A tentacle caught him. It wrapped around his waist, squeezing with the force of a hydraulic press.

"Monkey!" Bajie fired his boosters, flying up to help.

The Kraken caught Bajie too, snagging his mech suit with a second tentacle.

"Now!" the Kraken seemed to think.

It didn't crush them. It pushed off the planet. It released its grip on the core—not to spare the world, but to reduce its mass.

It launched itself into the void, dragging Wukong and Bajie with it.

"It's using us as counterweights!" Tianji screamed. "It's trying to slingshot itself out of the gravity well!"

"Not on my watch!" Wukong roared. He expanded the Dragon Tooth Staff, jamming it into the Kraken's beak to keep it open.

They tumbled through the atmosphere, a ball of thrashing limbs and energy, falling up towards the event horizon.
