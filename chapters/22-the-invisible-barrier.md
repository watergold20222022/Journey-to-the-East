The journey to the Ninth Sector was a test of endurance for both machine and spirit. The *Sky Rake* screamed through the warp-lanes, its hull groaning under the stress of the enhanced engines.

"Radiation spike in the port nacelle!" Alice shouted over the roar of the atmospheric scrubbers. "The shielding is fluctuating!"

"I'm on it," Tianji said calmly. He didn't move from his seat. Instead, his silver skin seemed to mist, and a swarm of nanobots flowed from his fingertips into the ship's console. On the schematic, the red warning light turned green instantly. "I have re-routed the thermal conduits and reinforced the molecular lattice of the port shield. Efficiency is now at 104%."

Bajie, gripping his safety harness, shook his head. "Show-off."

"It is not showing off," Tianji replied, his face forming a polite smile. "It is efficient survival. If we explode, I cannot finish the novel Alice lent me."

"You're reading romance novels?" Alice laughed, despite the tension.

"It is efficient for understanding biological emotional vectors," Tianji said innocently.

The voyage was plagued by such incidents—micro-meteoroid impacts, quantum turbulence, navigational drifts—but each time, Tianji's processing power and adaptability saved them. He solved complex astrological calculations in nanoseconds and repaired hardware failures with his own body mass. By the time they dropped out of warp, even Bajie had stopped making "tin can" jokes.

"Dropping out of warp in 3... 2... 1..." Alice announced.

The stars stopped streaking and settled into points of light. Dominating the view was Planet Kunlun.

It was breathtaking. A world of pure crystal, reflecting the light of a distant blue giant star. It shimmered with auroras of gold and violet, a jewel hanging in the velvet dark.

"It's beautiful," Alice whispered.

"And deadly," Tianji noted. "Surface gravity is 4.5 times standard. Atmospheric pressure is... nonexistent. But the energy readings are off the charts."

Bajie unbuckled his harness and floated over to the sensor station. He pulled out the Golden Staff—or rather, a fragment of it he had brought from the core (Wait, no, the Staff was too heavy to move. He had brought the diary). He pulled out the Master's diary.

"The resonance," Bajie said. "It's screaming."

The book was vibrating so hard it hummed. The tracking display on the console was a solid red line.

"Target is close," Alice said, her fingers flying over the keys. "Extremely close. Distance: 500 kilometers. Bearing: 0-4-0. He's on the surface."

"Take us down," Bajie ordered.

They landed the *Sky Rake* on a flat plateau of obsidian glass. The landing struts crunched into the crystal, the ship's grav-generators whining to compensate for the planet's crushing pull.

Bajie, Alice, and Tianji suited up. Tianji didn't need a suit, but he wore a protective cloak to prevent radiation interference with his sensors.

They stepped out onto the surface. The silence was absolute. The sky was a kaleidoscope of cosmic energy.

"Signal is strongest here," Bajie said, checking his wrist-comp. He walked toward a massive formation of crystal spires. "He should be right in front of us."

They walked for an hour, the signal getting stronger with every step. Finally, they reached the epicenter.

It was a clearing surrounded by towering pillars of transparent quartz.

"Right here," Bajie said, stopping. He looked around. "He's right here."

But there was no one.

"Is he... invisible?" Alice asked, switching her visor to thermal. "No heat signatures. No movement."

"Tianji?" Bajie asked.

The robot stood perfectly still, his head tilting as he processed data. "The signal is indeed originating from this coordinate. However, my quantum sensors indicate a phase variance. The mass shadow is present, but the optical photons are not reflecting off any matter."

"Speak plain!" Bajie snapped, spinning in a circle, swinging his rake at the empty air. "Brother! Monkey! Are you here?"

"He is here," Tianji said slowly. "But he is not *when* here. The temporal signature of the signal is desynchronized from our local time by approximately... 0.004 seconds. Or perhaps 400 years. The reading is paradoxical."

Bajie fell to his knees. He slammed his fist into the crystal ground. "So he's a ghost? I traveled across the galaxy to find a ghost?"

"Not a ghost," Alice said, kneeling beside him. "A prisoner. Remember what Tybalt said about the Archives? The humans didn't just experiment with genes. They experimented with time."

Bajie looked at the empty clearing. He could feel Wukong's presence. It was so strong it made his teeth ache. But he couldn't see him. He couldn't touch him.

"We found him," Bajie whispered, the victory tasting like ash in his mouth. "But we can't reach him."

"We can," Tianji said. The robot walked to the center of the clearing and placed his hand on the ground. His silver skin began to glow. "The barrier is physics. Physics is just math. And I am very good at math."

"We just need to find the equation," Tianji looked up, his eyes glowing blue. "And break it."

The team stood on the silent, beautiful world, staring at the invisible wall that separated the brothers, resolved to tear the universe apart if that's what it took to bring them together.
