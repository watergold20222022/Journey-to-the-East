# Chapter 89: Traces in the Ash

The *Sky Rake* descended through the smoggy atmosphere of Planet Lament. The air was thick with smoke, but the fires that had raged across the surface were now smoldering embers.

"Atmosphere quality improving," Tianji announced from the pilot's seat. "Particulate matter is settling. I'm detecting large-scale terraforming activity. Someone is cleaning this place up."

Wukong stood at the viewport, his eyes scanning the ground below. He saw the crater where the King of Inspiration's fortress had once stood. Now, it was a twisted ruin of metal and glass.

"Set us down there," Wukong pointed to a clearing near the ruins. "Where the energy reading is strongest."

The ship landed with a heavy thud. The ramp lowered, and the trio stepped out onto the scorched earth.

The ground was still warm. The air smelled of ozone, burnt plastic, and old magic.

"This place..." Bajie looked around, wrinkling his nose. "It smells like a barbecue gone wrong. And... is that incense?"

"Sandalwood," Wukong nodded. "Celestial incense. High grade. Used to calm the spirits."

They walked towards the center of the ruins. Everywhere they looked, they saw signs of a titanic battle. Massive gouges in the earth. Steel beams melted like wax. And here and there, the unmistakable scorch marks of the Fire-tipped Spear.

"Look at this," Tianji knelt beside a piece of debris. He scanned it with his multi-tool. "Two distinct energy signatures. One is chaotic, high-temperature plasma—likely the Red Boy. The other is disciplined, harmonic photon energy."

"Nezha," Bajie said. "So they were fighting here."

"Or fighting together," Wukong corrected. He pointed to a fallen walker unit. It had been sliced clean in half, but the cut was cauterized instantly. "That's a team effort. One held it, the other cut it."

A group of small figures emerged from the wreckage of a nearby shelter. They were children, dressed in scavenged armor, holding makeshift weapons. They looked wary but not afraid.

"Stay back!" one of the older girls shouted, aiming a pulse rifle that was clearly too big for her. "We are the Lament Guard! State your business!"

Wukong chuckled. "Guard? You look more like a kindergarten class."

"Don't mock them, Monkey," Bajie whispered. "Look at their eyes. They've seen things."

Wukong softened his expression. He crouched down. "We're not here to fight. We're looking for... old friends. A boy with red hair. And a man with wheels of fire."

The girl lowered her rifle slightly. "Teacher? And the Lotus Prince?"

"Teacher?" Bajie raised an eyebrow. "That brat was teaching you?"

"Teacher Red Boy saved us," the girl said defiantly. "He and Prince Nezha. They defeated the Fish King. They gave us back our planet."

"Saved you," Wukong repeated, a strange look on his face. He looked at the devastation around them, then at the confident posture of the children. "He actually did a good deed."

"Where are they now?" Tianji asked.

"Teacher led the Prince away," a smaller boy piped up. "He said he had to go settle a score. He said he's been looking for a monkey to fight for five hundred years."

Wukong rubbed his temples. "Of course he did."

"They went to the moon," the girl pointed up at the pale sphere of Crateris hanging in the daylight sky. "We saw the flashes. Then... the red star flew away. And the Prince went back to the stars."

"So they split up," Bajie said. "Red Boy ran, and Nezha chased... or didn't."

Wukong stood up. He looked at the sky.

"Nezha wouldn't just leave," Wukong said. "If he let Red Boy go, he has to report it. He'll be heading back to the nearest relay station. Potalaka."

"You want to follow Nezha?" Bajie asked. "Why? He's a celestial cop. We're tech-heretics."

"Because Nezha knows things," Wukong said. "He knows what the Court is planning. He knows where the other pieces of the board are. And... if he worked with Red Boy, maybe he's not as brainwashed as the others."

"Brainwashed?" Tianji asked.

"The Heavenly Court runs on strict programming," Wukong explained. "Order. Obedience. For Nezha to break protocol... means his firewall is cracking."

He turned back to the ship.

"We find Nezha," Wukong decided. "We get him to talk. And maybe... just maybe... he can tell us where the real Tripitaka is."

"And Red Boy?" Bajie asked.

"Let him run," Wukong smirked. "If he wants to fight me, he'll find me. He always does."

They boarded the *Sky Rake*. Wukong took one last look at the children standing guard over their broken home.

"He taught them well," Wukong muttered. "Not bad, brat. Not bad."

The ramp closed. The engines fired. The ship blasted off, leaving the dust of Planet Lament behind, chasing the faint ion trail of the Lotus Prince.
