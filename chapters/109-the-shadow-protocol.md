# Chapter 109: The Shadow Protocol

The data packet from the crippled *Silent Night* took hours to reach *The Crucible*, carried by emergency tight-beam-laser relays. When it finally arrived, the silence in Pangu's throne room was heavier than a neutron star.

The holographic replay of Nezha destroying their elite Vanguard played on a loop. The boy in the red sash moved with a fluidity that defied physics, his spear cutting through hyper-alloy like it was paper.

"Total mission failure," a high-ranking technician whispered, shaking. "Team Icarus has been neutralized. The target, Identity 'Nezha', is classed as an Omega-Level Threat."

Pangu’s avatar—the giant bearded god—flickered. The station's lights dimmed as the AI diverted power to its anger processing subroutines.

"Arrogance," Pangu’s voice was a low growl. "We were arrogant. We thought we could catch a god with a net designed for beasts."

"Sir, should we deploy the Second Fleet?" his tactical officer asked. "We can overload the sector with antimatter-bombs. If we cannot capture him, we can disintegrate him."

"No," Pangu snapped. "Did you not see? He manipulated the fundamental laws of space-time. Antimatter would just be fuel to him. Besides... the Federation is already on its way. If we make too much noise, we bring the entire Terran Armada down on our heads."

The avatar paced back and forth in the digital space.

"The Vanguard failed because they tried to assert dominance," Pangu analyzed. "You cannot dominate a storm. You must weather it. You must become part of it."

He turned to the darkness at the back of the laboratory. There was a sealed chamber there, marked with the sign of a monkey with six ears.

"We withdraw," Pangu announced. "Recall all combat units to deep cloak. Let the Federation poke the hornet's nest. Let Commander Vance fight the Third Prince. We will watch."

"Sir? We are giving up?"

"We are shifting tactics," Pangu corrected. "We are initiating the Shadow Protocol."

The sealed chamber hissed open. Inside, there was no giant monster, no armored juggernaut. There was a figure of pure, shifting shadow. It had no fixed face, but its hearing receptors were oversized, capable of detecting a whisper across a solar system.

"Project *Liu-Er*," Pangu introduced. "The Macaque. It does not fight. It listens. It learns. It copies."

The shadow figure stepped out. It rippled, taking on the appearance of the technician for a split second, then reverting to black.

"Go to the Primus System," Pangu commanded the shadow. "Do not engage Nezha. Do not engage Wukong. Simply observe. Learn their techniques. Memorize their spiritual frequencies. And when they are weak... when they are distracted... take their place."

The Six-Eared Macaque bowed. It didn't speak, but the air around it vibrated with a mocking laughter.

"The Gods are powerful," Pangu sneered. "But even a God casts a shadow. And in the shadow, we shall rule."
