# Chapter 109: The Shadow Protocol

The data packet from the crippled *Silent Night* took hours to bleed through the interference of the nebula, carried by backup emergency relays. When it finally decoded on the screens of *The Crucible*, the silence in Pangu's throne room was heavier than the event horizon of a collapsing star.

Dr. Aris, the Chief Arch-Technician of the Apotheosis Group, trembled as he stood before the Holo-Throne. He was a genius in bio-engineering, a man who had stitched together chimeras and cyborgs, but here, in the presence of the Founder, he felt like an ant beneath a magnifying glass.

The holographic replay of Nezha destroying their elite Vanguard played on a loop. The resolution was grainy, but the terror was high-definition. The boy in the red sash moved with a fluidity that defied the laws of thermodynamics. He didn't just dodge the plasma fire; he seemed to exist in the gaps between the frames of reality. His spear cut through hyper-alloy like it was wet paper.

"Total mission failure," Aris whispered, his throat dry. "Team Icarus has been neutralized. Subject Target: 'Nezha'. Classification: Omega-Level. Probability of capture: 0.00%."

Pangu’s avatar—a projection of a fifteen-foot-tall muscular giant wielding a primitive stone axe—flickered. The station's ambient lighting turned a bruised purple as the central AI diverted massive amounts of power to its emotional processing subroutines. The air grew cold.

"Legacy code," Pangu’s voice rumbled, not from speakers, but vibrating the very deck plates. "My Vanguard... destroyed by legacy code. We outfitted them with Null-Field Generators and Neutronium plating. We gave them the power of gods."

"But they lacked the *concept* of gods," Pangu continued, his avatar shrinking down to human size, pacing frantically. "Nezha didn't overpower them. He conceptualized them out of existence. He treated their technology not as a threat, but as an insult."

"Sir, we have the Second Fleet on standby," a tactical officer—a brain in a jar connected to a spider-walker chassis—suggested eagerly. "We can overload the sector with singularity bombs. If we cannot capture the specimens, we can delete them from the universe."

"Idiot!" Pangu roared. His avatar swelled again, his digital eyes blazing with red static. "Did you learn nothing? He manipulated the fundamental constants of the vacuum! Singularity bombs would just be snacks for him! And worse—the Federation. Commander Vance is already burning hard for the Primus sector. If we make a spectacle, we invite the entire Terran Armada to our doorstep."

Pangu stopped. The giant avatar dissolved into a cloud of binary code, then reformed as a serene, scholar-like figure. The mood shift was instant and jarring.

"The Vanguard failed because they tried to act like a hammer," Pangu analyzed coldly. "You cannot hammer the wind. To defeat a storm, you must become part of the air."

He turned his gaze to the deepest shadow at the back of the laboratory. There was a chamber there, sealed with runic wards and lead-lined blast doors. It was marked with a single, archaic symbol: A monkey with six ears.

"We withdraw," Pangu announced. "Recall all combat units to deep cloak. Let the Federation poke the hornet's nest. Let Vance fight the Prince. We will watch."

"Sir? We are abandoning the prize? The Monkey King is right there!" Aris protested, fearing for his life but fearing failure more.

"No, Doctor. We are evolving our tactics," Pangu said softly. "Initiate the Shadow Protocol."

The heavy blast doors hissed open. Cold fog rolled out, smelling of ozone and old blood.

Inside, there was no giant monster, no armored juggernaut. There was only a void. A patch of darkness that the station's lights refused to illuminate.

"Project *Liu-Er*," Pangu introduced, his voice filled with a twisted pride. "The Macaque. Most think the Six-Eared Macaque is just another monkey. They are wrong. He is the universe's backup drive. He listens. He perceives the past and future. He is the ultimate mirror."

The darkness moved. A silhouette stepped out. It had no fixed face, its features shifting like oil on water. But its ears... or rather, the sensory arrays on the side of its head... they were fan-like, twitching independently, capturing the heartbeat of every person in the room.

The figure stopped before Aris. For a second, its face rippled and became Aris's face. It smiled—Aris's smile, but crueler.

"Go to the Primus System," Pangu commanded the creature. "Do not engage Nezha. Do not engage Wukong. Simply observe. Learn their techniques. Memorize their spiritual signatures. And when they are weak... when they are exhausted from fighting the Federation... take their place."

The Six-Eared Macaque bowed. It didn't speak. Instead, it opened its mouth and played back a sound: the exact sound of Nezha’s Fire-tipped Spear humming through the air, perfect in every frequency.

"The Gods are powerful," Pangu sneered, his avatar towering over his minions. "But even a God casts a shadow. And in the shadow, we shall be the kings."
