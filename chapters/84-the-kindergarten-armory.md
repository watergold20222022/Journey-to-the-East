# Chapter 84: The Kindergarten Armory

With the army drilled and the commanders trained, there was only one thing missing.

"Firepower," Nezha said, looking at the crude clubs and pipes the children were using. "Courage is great, but a plasma rifle is better."

They converted Sector 4 of the factory into an R&D lab.

Nezha’s approach to weapon design was traditional Heavenly Engineering: sleek, reliable, high-output. Red Boy’s approach was chaotic, customized, and dangerous.

Together, they created: **Hybrid Arms.**

"Stop complaining," Nezha told a young girl named Kiki, who was struggling to lift a massive cannon. "It’s not too heavy. Your center of gravity is wrong."

Kiki was a gravity-manipulator. She frowned, concentrating. The cannon suddenly became weightless in her hands.

"Better," Nezha nodded. "Now, this is the 'Lotus-X Pulse Rifle'. It fires bursts of concentrated solar energy. It has zero recoil if you sync your breathing with the cooling vents."

Across the room, Red Boy was fitting a gauntlet onto Rolo’s arm.

"It looks... sharp," Rolo said nervously. The gauntlet had three retractable blades made of obsidian glass.

"It is," Red Boy tightened a bolt. "It connects to your nervous system. When you get angry, the blades heat up. When you get *really* angry, they explode."

"Explode?" Rolo yelped.

"Regeneratively," Red Boy assured him. "They shatter into shrapnel, then reform. It’s a good surprise for anyone trying to eat you."

They spent days outfitting the Vanguard. For the telekinetics, Nezha built floating drones that amplified their mental reach. For the pyrokinetics, Red Boy designed suits that absorbed heat, turning the user into a walking thermal bomb.

The factory floor became a testing ground.

"Target practice!" Nezha yelled.

Fifty children raised their new weapons.

"Fire!"

A wall of energy—blue, red, purple, gold—slammed into the target range. The rusted hulks of old tanks were vaporized instantly.

Nezha whistled. "Not bad. A bit messy, but effective."

"They lack precision," Red Boy critiqued, but he looked pleased. "But the raw output is... acceptable."

In the evenings, the factory turned into something else. It wasn't just a fortress; it was a home. The Golems stood guard outside, their orange eyes glowing in the smog. Inside, the children ate hot meals produced by the repaired replicators. They polished their weapons. They told stories.

Nezha and Red Boy sat apart, on their usual observation deck.

"They are ready," Nezha said quietly. "If the slavers come back, they won't find victims. They'll find a meat grinder."

"The Guard will be here in two days," Red Boy said, checking the long-range scanners. "Our shift is almost over."

"What will you do?" Nezha asked. "After this?"

"I still have a monkey to find," Red Boy stared into the dark. "And you have a arrest warrant to execute."

"Technically," Nezha leaned back. "I haven't found you yet. My report says I'm still tracking a 'Void anomaly' in this sector."

Red Boy looked at him. "You are a terrible General."

"And you," Nezha grinned. "Are a terrible villain."

They sat in silence, watching the children sleep below, their new weapons held close like teddy bears.
