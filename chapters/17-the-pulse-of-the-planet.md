The central laboratory of the Special Research Group was a hive of activity, but at the center of the storm, Zhu Bajie sat in perfect stillness. In front of him, on a pedestal of anti-gravity fields, floated the diary of Tang Seng.

"Focus, Captain," the lead psychic researcher, a blind Mole-Man named Simon, whispered. "The captured sensors are synchronized. We just need a spark."

Bajie closed his eyes and placed his hands on the worn leather cover. He didn't use magic; he used memory. He remembered the rain on the road to India, the taste of the vegetarian meals the Master insisted on sharing, the gentle scolding when Bajie complained about hunger.

*Master,* he thought. *Where are you?*

A faint hum began to emanate from the book. It wasn't sound; it was pure spiritual energy. The golden characters on the pages began to glow.

"We have a spike!" a technician shouted. "Resonance detected!"

But the signal didn't point to the stars. It didn't point to the captured human fleet or the infinite void.

"Captain," Alice said, her voice trembling as she looked at the 3D map. "The signal... it's inverted."

Bajie opened his eyes. "Inverted?"

"It's not coming from space," Alice said, pointing downwards. "It's coming from below. Deep below. The signal from the book bounced, and we got a ping back from the Planetary Core."

The room went silent. The core of Planet Kara was a mystery even to the Beast-Men. It was a churning cauldron of geothermal energy and magnetic fields, encased in layers of unimaginable pressure.

"Someone is down there?" Bajie asked, disbelief coloring his voice. "In the magma?"

"Not someone," Simon corrected, tilting his head. "Something. A resonance chamber. Or a prison. It matches the Master's frequency perfectly."

"Then we dig," Bajie said, standing up. "We get a drill, and we go down."

But General Rakafa, who had been observing from the back, shook his head. "It is not that simple, my friend. Our mining technology only goes down to the mantle. The core pressure is millions of atmospheres. We don't have a hull that can survive it. We don't have the shielding."

Bajie deflated. "So he's right there, under my feet, and I can't reach him?"

"We would need to build a vessel from scratch," Rakafa explained, walking over to the holographic display of the planet. "New alloys. New thermal dampeners. A completely new propulsion system. It could take months. Years."

The weight of the words hit Bajie like a mountain. Years. He had already waited five hundred. The thought of waiting longer, knowing the Master was so close yet so far, was crushing.

"We don't have years," Bajie muttered. He turned away from the group, his shoulders slumped. The hero of the sky felt defeated by the earth.

He walked out of the lab, ignoring the salutes of the guards. He needed air. He needed silence.

He found himself wandering down to the lower levels, back to the Underground Market where he had first met Alice. The neon lights were still garish, the smells still pungent, but now people pointed and whispered "The Pig-King" as he passed. He ignored them.

He found the hidden Temple of the Merciful Observer. It was cleaner now—someone had been tending to it since his rise to fame—but it was still humble.

Bajie knelt before the rough stone statue of Guanyin. He didn't bow as a marshal or a captain. He bowed as a tired pig.

"Bodhisattva," he whispered, clasping his hands. "You saved the Monkey. You saved the Dragon. Why is the path always so hard for the Pig?"

He looked up at the serene, stone face.

"I am strong enough to smash a fleet," he confessed. "But I am not smart enough to build a drill. I am not patient enough to wait. I miss them. I miss the bickering. I miss the road."

"Then let us build the road for you."

Bajie turned. Alice stood in the doorway, illuminated by the flickering candlelight. Behind her was Rakafa, squeezed into the small entrance, and Tybalt, leaning against the frame.

"You're not doing this alone, Bajie," Alice said, walking over and kneeling beside him. "Rakafa has mobilized the entire Engineering Corps. We're recalling every metallurgist, every geologist. We're stripping the armor off the human warships to build your hull."

"It will still take time," Rakafa rumbled gently. "But we are Beast-Men. We were bred for labor. We were bred to build the impossible for our masters. Now, we will build it for our friend."

"You don't have to carry the sky by yourself," Tybalt added, flipping a coin. "Even heroes need a support crew."

Bajie looked at them—the fox, the bull, the tiger. He saw the same loyalty in their eyes that he had once seen in Wukong and Sha Seng.

He wiped a tear from his snout and stood up. He bowed to the statue of Guanyin one last time.

"Thank you," he whispered to the goddess. Then he turned to his friends.

"Alright," Bajie said, a fire returning to his eyes. "Let's build a drill. And let's make it big enough to kick the devil's door down."

The project to breach the core had begun. And this time, the Pig-King wasn't just a passenger; he was the foreman.
