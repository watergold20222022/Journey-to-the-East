# Chapter 102: Falling into the Horizon

Space was silent, but the radio channels were a chaotic storm of static and screaming.

"Release the grapple!" Tianji's voice cut through the noise. "Wukong! Bajie! You are crossing the accretion disk! The radiation levels are spiking!"

Wukong couldn't hear him clearly. The gravity of the *Maw of Kara* was singing in his bones. It was a physical weight, heavier than any mountain he had ever been crushed under.

The Void Kraken was thrashing wildly. It realized too late that its trajectory was flawed. It had pushed off the planet successfully, but the mass of the two "gnats" it carried was greater than it anticipated. Bajie's exosuit was made of dense neutronium alloy, and Wukong... Wukong was dense with spiritual energy.

They were heavy anchors.

"Let go!" the Kraken seemed to screech psychically. Its tentacles uncoiled, trying to shake them off.

"Oh no you don't!" Bajie yelled. He activated his suit's magnetic clamps, locking onto the Kraken's beak. "You wanted a ride? We're going all the way!"

"Bajie, get off!" Wukong shouted, climbing over the monster's head. "I can jump off its back! I can get us back to the ship!"

"Not both of us!" Bajie grunted, straining against the G-force. "Suit's thrusters are dead! I'm just dead weight, monkey! Use me as a launchpad and get out of here!"

"Shut up, you idiot!" Wukong jammed his staff into the Kraken's hide, anchoring himself. "I'm not leaving you!"

The black hole loom below them—a perfect sphere of absolute darkness, ringed by a halo of blinding, superheated gas. The light around them was warping. Stars were smearing into streaks.

They hit the photon sphere. Light itself was trapped here, orbiting endlessly. Wukong saw the back of his own head for a split second—a ghostly image trapped in the gravity well.

"Tianji!" Wukong yelled, his voice distorted by the time dilation. "Take care of the planet! We're taking this calamari to hell!"

"Wukong! The event horizon! You cannot return!" Tianji’s voice was slow, deep, stretching out into a drone.

The Kraken wailed, a sound that propagated through the thin plasma of the accretion disk. It tried to fire its void engines, but space itself was flowing inwards faster than light. It was like trying to swim up a waterfall.

Wukong looked at Bajie. The pig demon was grinning inside his helmet, though sweat was pouring down his face.

"Hey, monkey," Bajie wheezed. "Bet the food down there is terrible."

"Worst in the galaxy," Wukong agreed.

They crossed the line.

The universe above them shrank to a single point of light, then vanished. The darkness swallowed them whole. The Kraken's screams cut off instantly as the radio waves could no longer escape to reach the ship above.

They were gone.

On the bridge of the *Sky Rake*, Tianji stared at the sensors. One moment, there were three distinct energy signatures. The next, there was nothing. Just the flat, infinite reading of the singularity.

"Master..." Tianji whispered. He slumped into his chair, the silence of the cockpit deafening.

The planet below, *Primus*, turned slowly in the void, safe. The Kraken was gone. But so were the connection to the West, the Golden Cicada's protectors, and his only friends in the universe.

Tianji looked at the primitive world. He was alone.
