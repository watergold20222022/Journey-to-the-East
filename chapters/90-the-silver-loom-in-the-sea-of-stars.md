# Chapter 90: The Silver Loom in the Sea of Stars

The ion trail of the Lotus Prince was a burning scar in the vacuum, easy enough for Tianji's sensors to follow—at least, until they hit the nebula.

It appeared on the viewport like a spilled bottle of pearlescent ink. A swirling, luminous cloud of gas and dust that shimmered with colors the human eye couldn't quite name. It stretched across three parsecs, a silent, glowing barrier between them and the deep void.

"The Gossamer Nebula," Tianji announced, his voice tinged with a rare note of caution. "Navigational charts list this sector as 'Forbidden'. No Federation ships enter. None return."

"Nezha went in," Wukong said, staring at the mesmerizing swirls of light. "The trail goes straight through the center."

"Nezha is a god made of lotus root and fusion fire," Bajie grunted from the co-pilot seat. "We are... well, less durable. Are you sure about this, Monkey?"

"We're already here," Wukong strapped himself into the crash couch. "Punch it, Scholar. Keep the shields up."

Tianji engaged the thrusters. The *Sky Rake* surged forward, diving into the mist.

Inside, the universe changed. The stars vanished, replaced by a soft, ambient glow that seemed to come from everywhere at once. It wasn't dark; it was too bright. A hazy, dreamlike brilliance that scattered the ship’s headlights.

"Sensors are... confused," Tianji frowned, tapping at his console. "I'm reading zero obstacles, but drag coefficient is increasing. It's like flying through syrup."

"It's pretty," Bajie murmured, his eyes wide. He pressed his snout against the glass. "Look at those filaments. Like silver rain."

Outside, billions of microscopic threads drifted in the gas. They weren't just dust. They were structured. Long, impossibly thin molecular chains that caught the light and refracted it into rainbows.

The ship slowed down. The engines roared, pushing against a resistance that wasn't there a moment ago.

"We're losing velocity," Tianji warned. "Engine output at 110%, but speed is dropping. 80%... 60%..."

"It's the dust," Wukong realized. "It's binding. It's not just floating; it's sticky."

"It's magnetic," Tianji corrected, his mechanical eyes spinning. "No, it's *gravitational*. Each strand is creating a micro-singularity. We are being caught in a web of event horizons."

"Cut the engines!" Wukong ordered. "If we fight it, we'll tear the hull apart!"

Tianji killed the power. The roar of the thrusters died, leaving only the hum of the life support.

The ship didn't stop immediately. It drifted, caught in a gentle, inexorable current. They were no longer flying; they were being pulled.

"We are caught," Tianji stated calmly. "The current is taking us inward. Towards the center of mass."

"Well, that's one way to travel," Bajie unbuckled his belt. He didn't seem worried. In fact, he looked strangely relaxed. "Why fight it? Let's see where it goes. Maybe there's a palace in there. Or a banquet."

Wukong looked at Bajie sharply. "Pig, snap out of it. You're drooling."

" am I?" Bajie wiped his mouth. "I just feel... safe. It's warm here. Nice."

"Atmospheric scrubbers are failing," Tianji noted, his speech slowing down slightly. "Psycho-active compounds detected in the nebula gas. Hull integrity is... immaterial. We are... processing..."

Tianji’s head slumped forward. The robot went into standby mode.

"Tianji!" Wukong shook the android. He looked at his own hands. They felt heavy. Golden fur blurred into the silver light.

He grabbed the Golden Staff, trying to summon the clarity of combat. But the staff felt like a distant memory, a heavy iron rod that belonged to someone else.

"Sleep, Brother," Bajie yawned, curling up in the pilot's chair. "We're going to the center. To the Spider's parlor. It's going to be... lovely."

Wukong tried to slap him, but his hand moved through the air like he was underwater. His eyelids were made of lead. The soft, white light filled his vision, drowning out the warning sirens, drowning out the mission, drowning out the pain.

The *Sky Rake* drifted deeper into the nebula, a silver fly caught in a web the size of a solar system, pulled gently towards the crystal planet waiting in the dark.
