# Chapter 83: The Sparks That Fight

"Formation!" Nezha’s voice cracked like a whip.

In the courtyard of the factory, fifty children snapped to attention. They were a motley crew—humans, beast-men, silicon-based lifeforms, and energy beings. They were small, malnourished, and scared.

But they were standing.

"You are not protected anymore," Nezha walked down the line, his hands behind his back. "The universe is dark. The universe is hungry. The only thing that stops you from being eaten is your ability to bite back."

He stopped in front of a young beast-man boy—a tiger cub with glowing stripes. This was the one who had tried to bite the King's leg when he was captured.

"Name?" Nezha barked.

"Rolo," the boy squeaked.

"Louder!"

"ROLO!"

"Good," Nezha nodded. "You have fire in your belly, Rolo. But fire without control is just a tantrum. I will teach you how to burn."

He raised his hand. Hard-light diagrams appeared in the air—tactical formations, martial arts stances, energy flow charts.

"This is the Lament Vanguard," Nezha announced. "You are the heavy hitters. If the Golems fall, you are the last line of defense."

While Nezha drilled them on physical combat and discipline, Red Boy sat on a crate in the corner, surrounded by a smaller, quieter group.

These were the children with "Talent." The psionics. The empaths. The ones who had accidentally blown up lightbulbs when they cried.

"Close your eyes," Red Boy whispered.

The children obeyed.

"What do you feel?" Red Boy asked.

"Fear," a pale girl with white eyes whispered. "I feel the fear of everyone in the factory."

"Good," Red Boy said. "Now, don't run from it. Eat it."

The girl opened her eyes. "Eat it?"

"Fear is energy," Red Boy explained, holding up a small black flame on his finger. "Pain is fuel. If you let it crush you, you are a battery for someone else. But if you take it, if you make it yours... then you are the engine."

He tossed the flame to the girl. She caught it. It didn't burn her. Instead, it turned into a sphere of white cold.

"It's... cold," she marveled.

"That's your alignment," Red Boy noted. "Entropy. You are a natural at the Void arts."

He looked at the group. "The world broke you. I know what that feels like. But broken things have sharp edges. I will teach you how to cut."

For two weeks, the routine was grueling. Nezha taught them how to move as a unit, how to cover each other, how to use leverage to bring down larger opponents. Red Boy taught them how to access their core trauma and turn it into magical output.

They called Nezha "The General." They called Red Boy "The Teacher."

One evening, after training, Rolo and the white-eyed girl (whose name was Nova) sat on the roof, watching the sunset through the smog.

"They are different," Rolo said, nursing a bruised arm. "Nezha wants us to be soldiers. He talks about honor."

"Red Boy is different," Nova said, playing with a ball of frost in her hand. "He doesn't talk about honor. He talks about survival. He says the only rule is to win."

"Who is right?"

"Both," Nova crushed the frost ball. "We need to be soldiers to fight. But we need to be monsters to win."

Below them, in the shadow of the factory, Nezha and Red Boy watched their students.

"They are getting strong," Nezha noted. "Too strong, maybe. Rolo almost punched a hole in a Golem today."

"Good," Red Boy said. "Weakness is a sin."

"You care about them," Nezha smirked.

"I am investing in assets," Red Boy turned away, but Nezha saw the ghost of a smile.

"Keep telling yourself that, Prince of Night."
