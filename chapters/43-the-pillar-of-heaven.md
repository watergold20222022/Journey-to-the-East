# Chapter 43: The Pillar of Heaven

The luminous path ended not at a clearing, but at a wall.

At least, it looked like a wall at first—a sheer, vertical cliff of rugged, moss-covered bark that stretched endlessly to the left and right. Tang Seng craned his neck, looking up, but the structure pierced the clouds and vanished into the violet sky.

"This..." Ao Lie murmured, stepping back to take it in. "This is not a tree. This is a mountain made of wood."

"The Mother Tree," Sentry-7 announced, its sensors scanning the surface. "Diameter at base: forty kilometers. Height: extending beyond the planetary troposphere. It is a biological space elevator."

They stood at the roots, which were thick enough to house entire cities in their crevices. The air here was vibrating with power—a deep, resonant thrum that Tang Seng could feel in his bones. It was the heartbeat of the world.

"How do we speak to it?" Ao Lie asked, placing a hand on the bark.

Sentry-7 extended a data-spike from its wrist, searching for a port or a nerve cluster. "I am attempting a direct link... Negative. The bio-encryption is totally unlike the peripheral nodes. There is no interface."

Tang Seng walked along the root system. "It is too vast," he said. "We are like ants trying to speak to a human emperor. We are too small to be noticed."

Suddenly, a shadow fell over them. A gust of wind nearly knocked Tang Seng off his feet.

Descending from the canopy was a bird—if such a word could describe it. It was a Roc, vast and glorious, with feathers that shimmered like hammered gold and eyes that burned with intelligence. Its wingspan blocked out the local sun.

It landed on a root projection high above them, folding its wings with a sound like thunder. It looked down at the tiny figures, tilting its head.

"It is curious," Tang Seng observed, feeling the same empathy wave he had used earlier. "It offers... a ride?"

Ao Lie hesitated. "Master, it is a beast. Are you sure?"

"It is a messenger," Tang Seng said with conviction. He climbed onto the lower roots. The great bird lowered its head, allowing the monk, the dragon prince, and the robot to scramble onto its feathery back.

With a screech that echoed across the jungle, the bird took flight.

The ascent was a journey in itself. They spiraled up the trunk of the Mother Tree, passing through layers of ecology. They saw entire ecosystems living in the branches—lakes formed in the hollows of leaves, tribes of monkeys that never touched the ground, clouds of glittering insects.

And still, they went up.

The air grew thin. Sentry-7 deployed a localized oxygen field from its suit to protect Tang Seng. The sky shifted from violet to a deep, starry black.

They broke through the atmosphere.

Tang Seng gasped. They were in space, or the very edge of it. The top of the Mother Tree spread out like a green nebula, its leaves absorbing the unfiltered cosmic radiation.

But what took his breath away was the horizon.

Far in the distance, curving with the planet, he saw other pillars. Other Mother Trees, rising from different continents, their canopies linking together in the upper atmosphere to form a global shield. They were glowing, pulses of light traveling between them like neurons firing in a brain.

"The World Wide Web," Sentry-7 stated, its voice filled with awe. "Literally."

"It is a formation," Ao Lie whispered, clutching the bird's feathers. "A planetary defense array made of life."

The bird circled the apex of the tree, allowing them to witness the grandeur of Veridia Prime. It was a single organism, breathtaking and terrifying in its unity.

However, as they soared among the stars, Tang Seng realized something. The tree was silent here. It was busy absorbing starlight, maintaining the atmosphere, communicating with its siblings. It was too busy being a god to notice a monk.

"Take us down," Tang Seng whispered to the bird. "The answer is not in the sky."

The bird seemed to understand. It folded its wings and dived, plummeting back toward the rich, humid earth.

When they landed back at the roots, Tang Seng felt a heavy stillness settle over him. He stepped off the bird, bowing deeply in gratitude as it took flight again, disappearing into the clouds.

"Master?" Ao Lie asked. "Did you find the answer?"

Tang Seng looked at the massive wall of bark. He sat down in the lotus position, closing his eyes.

"The bird showed us the body," Tang Seng said softly. "But to speak to the mind, I must stop looking with my eyes."

He placed his palms on the ground.

"I must listen to the silence."

He sat there, small and still against the pillar that held up the sky. He would not shout. He would not fly. He would wait. He would let his own heartbeat sync with the planet's, until the Mother Tree had no choice but to hear the quietest voice in the forest.
