# Chapter 37: The Silent Paradise

Consciousness returned to Tang Seng not with a jolt, but like a slow tide washing over a shore. He opened his eyes, shielding them against a brilliant, prismatic sunlight filtering through a canopy of leaves that looked like stained glass.

He was lying on a bed of moss, but it was unlike any moss he had seen on Earth or the colonized planets. The tendrils were iridescent, pulsing with a gentle, rhythmic light that matched his own heartbeat. The air was rich and humid, smelling of jasmine, ozone, and something sweet like ripe peaches.

Tang Seng sat up, his golden Kasaya unblemished, though he remembered it being torn in the chaos. He touched his head, his fingers tracing the smooth skin. No pain. No dizziness.

"Where...?" he whispered.

He stood up, looking around. He was in a dense rainforest, but the scale was wrong. The ferns reached as high as skyscrapers, their fronds translucent and shimmering. Strange, multi-colored birds flitted between the branches, leaving trails of light in the air. On the ground, small creatures resembling rabbits with six legs and oversized, expressive eyes watched him with no fear, only curious innocence.

It was a paradise. A world of aggressive, overwhelming life.

Memory flickered in his mind—jagged shards of the past. The battle. The blazing fires of the Fire Cloud Cave. Wukong fighting the Red Boy with desperation. The sky tearing open—not just a portal, but a wound in reality itself, a swirling vortex of purple and black that threatened to swallow everything.

He remembered shouting Wukong's name. A blast of energy. Then... silence.

"Wukong?" Tang Seng called out tentatively.

His voice didn't echo. The dense foliage seemed to absorb the sound instantly.

"Bajie! Wujing!"

He turned in a circle, scanning the vibrant undergrowth. There was no sign of the Monkey King’s arrogance, the Pig’s lumbering form, or the River Demon’s stoic presence. He was alone.

Panic, cold and sharp, began to rise in his chest. He clutched his staff, the metal cool against his palm. He needed guidance.

"Om Mani Padme Hum," he chanted, closing his eyes, reaching out with his spiritual senses for the Bodhisattva Guanyin, for the Buddha, for any celestial presence that watched over their pilgrimage.

Nothing.

Usually, there was a hum—a distant, comforting vibration of the divine network. Now, there was only a void. It was as if the phone line had been cut. As if the server was down. As if this place existed outside the coverage area of the Heavens.

He opened his eyes, breathing heavily. The cheerful chirping of the alien birds felt mocking now. The beauty of the forest felt oppressive.

"I am... disconnected," he realized, a tremble in his voice.

He walked forward, pushing aside a massive, leafy frond. The landscape opened up into a valley filled with floating islands of rock, tethered to the ground by thick vines. Waterfalls cascaded from the floating rocks, turning into mist before they hit the ground. It was breathtakingly beautiful, a scene from a dream.

But the beauty only deepened his isolation. In the demon-infested wastelands, he had his disciples. In the dangerous cities, he had his mission. Here, in this perfect, silent world, he had nothing.

"Am I dead?" he wondered aloud. "Is this the Western Heaven? No... the Western Heaven would not feel so... lonely."

He looked at the small, six-legged creatures that were hopping closer, sniffing at his boots. One of them nudged his leg, making a soft purring sound. It was peaceful. Too peaceful.

"Where are you, Wukong?" he murmured, looking up at the strange, violet sky.

He knew he couldn't stay here staring at the flowers. If he was alive, then his disciples might be too. They might be hurt, lost, or fighting for their lives in this strange new dimension.

Tang Seng tightened his grip on his staff. The fear was still there, a cold knot in his stomach, but beneath it was a resolve that had been forged through fire and trials. He was the Master. He was the center of their chaotic little family.

"I will find you," he promised the empty air. "Wukong. Bajie. Wujing."

He took his first step into the alien jungle, his red robes a stark contrast to the shifting greens and blues of the silent paradise. He didn't know which way was West on this planet, or if 'West' even meant anything here. But he had to move. He had to search.

Because a paradise without his family was just a gilded cage.
