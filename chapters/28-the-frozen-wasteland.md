The *Sky Rake* could not land in the Northern Wastes. The atmospheric turbulence near the pole was a vortex of razor-sharp ice crystals that would strip the shielding off a battleship. So, the team had to walk.

They dropped into the transition zone, a bleak tundra where the grey rock of Planet Kara vanished beneath a crushing blanket of white.

"Thermal regulation active," Tianji announced. His chassis was heating up, glowing a dull orange against the blinding snow. "Temperature is dropping. Negative 80 degrees Celsius. Wind chill brings it to negative 120."

Bajie shivered, pulling his fur-lined cloak tighter. Even with his thick skin, the cold bit deep. "Why does evil always hide in the cold places? Why not a nice tropical island for once?"

"Stop whining," Wukong said. He was walking ahead, unbothered by the frost forming on his golden fur. He used his staff to test the ice, his eyes darting across the horizon. "Keep your eyes open. The seismic trail is getting faint."

The landscape was alien and hostile. Massive glaciers carved through the mountains like frozen rivers of glass. The sky was not blue, but a bruised purple, lit by the constant, shimmering curtain of the aurora borealis. Towering spires of ice, sculpted by the relentless wind, looked like the fangs of a giant beast waiting to snap the sky shut using the horizon as a jaw.

They trudged for hours. The silence was absolute, broken only by the crunch of their boots and the howling wind.

Then, the snow began to move.

"Contact!" Alice shouted, raising her pulse rifle. "Twelve o'clock! Under the ice!"

The ground exploded.

Massive shapes burst from the snowdrifts, shaking off the powder to reveal bodies of thick, matted white fur and armored chitin. They were the size of transport trucks, with six powerful limbs ending in obsidian claws. Their heads were faceless, save for a gaping maw filled with serrated rows of transparent teeth.

"Snow Stalkers!" Bajie yelled, swinging the nine-toothed rake. "Native fauna! Nasty tempers!"

The lead monster roared—a sound like cracking ice—and lunged at Bajie. Its claws raked against his armor, sending sparks flying. Bajie grunted, planting his feet and driving the rake upwards, catching the beast under the jaw.

"Get off me, you oversized snowball!" he shouted, heaving the creature over his shoulder. It crashed into a glacier, shattering a shelf of ice.

Two more beasts flanked Alice. She fired, her energy bolts scorching their fur but failing to penetrate the thick hide. "They're resistant to energy weapons!" she called out, rolling under a massive paw strike.

"Then use kinetic!" Wukong laughed.

The Monkey King vaulted into the air, spinning his staff until it was a blur of gold. He came down like a meteor, striking the nearest monster squarely on its spine. *CRACK.* The beast collapsed instantly.

Wukong didn't stop. He bounced off the fallen creature, kicking another in the chest with enough force to send it skidding fifty meters across the ice.

Tianji was efficient. He didn't move fast, but he moved perfectly. As a monster swiped at him, a laser cutter extended from his wrist, slicing through the creature's tendons. It fell, roaring in confusion.

"These predatory patterns are rudimentary," Tianji noted, stepping over a thrashing limb. "They hunt by vibration. Stop moving, and they cannot see you."

"A bit late for that!" Bajie grunted, wrestling a mouth full of teeth away from his face. "Help!"

Wukong extended his staff. "GROW!"

The iron rod shot forward, slamming into the side of the monster pinning Bajie. The beast was launched into the air, vanishing into the whiteout of the storm.

Within minutes, the ambush was over. Six massive carcasses lay steaming on the ice. The rest of the pack had retreated into the blizzard.

Wukong landed lightly on a pinnacle of ice, wiping sloth-blood from his armor. He looked North, his expression darkening.

"They were guarding something," search Wukong said. "Beasts like this don't hunt in packs unless they are commanded."

"Commanded?" Alice checked her scanner. "By who?"

"By whoever stole my stick," Wukong hopped down. "We're close. I can smell the ozone."

They pressed on, deeper into the storm. But despite the fight, despite the trail, the horizon remained empty. Endless white. Endless cold. And no sign of the thief.

"Are we lost?" Bajie asked, hours later, his voice hoarse.

"No," Tianji pointed. "Look."

Through a break in the storm, they saw it. Not a cave, or a fortress. But a structure of ice that defied nature. A perfect, geometric pyramid, sitting in the center of a frozen crater, glowing with a faint, green light.

"Well," Wukong grinned, baring his fangs. "That doesn't look like a natural formation."

He spun his staff. "Knock knock."
