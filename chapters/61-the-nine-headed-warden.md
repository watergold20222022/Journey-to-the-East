# Chapter 61: The Nine-Headed Warden

The darkness coalesced into a form that defied Euclidean geometry. It was a hound, titanic in scale, its fur made of flowing data streams and golden light. It had nine heads, each one wearing a different mask of cold, metallic judgment.

"Unidentified Anomaly," the nine heads spoke in unison, their voices creating a harmony that grated against Red Boy's skull. "Entropy levels exceeding safety threshold. Initiating Purge Protocol."

Red Boy didn't wait. He launched himself forward, the Shadow Flame on his spear trailing like a comet's tail. "Burn!"

He thrust the spear at the central head.

The head didn't move. Instead, its eyes flashed blue. *Gravitational Lock engaged.*

Red Boy stopped instantly. His momentum was erased. He hung in space, frozen, as if encasing in invisible amber. The gravity around him had increased a thousandfold. His bones creaked. His armor screamed.

"Subject detained," the Hound stated. "Applying correctional therapy."

The second head, glowing red, opened its maw. A beam of pure thermal energy—concentrated solar plasma—erupted towards him.

*Move!* the Prince's voice urged.

"I... can't!" Red Boy gritted out, blood trickling from his nose.

*You operate on their rules,* the Prince scolded. *Gravity exists only because you believe in mass. The Shadow Flame eats beliefs.*

Red Boy focused on the invisible weight crushing him. He didn't push back against it. He *infected* it. He poured the black fire into the gravitational field.

The blue light of the lock flickered, turning sickly violet. The field shattered like glass.

Red Boy dropped, the thermal beam missing him by inches. He rolled in the void and slashed upward. The black fire caught the red head's neck.

The beast howled—a sound of static feedback. The red head dissolved into code, then vanished.

"One down," Red Boy panted.

But the remaining eight heads roared. The third head (Silver) and fourth head (Green) attacked simultaneously.

Silver spat a cloud of metallic dust that solidified into razor-wire nets. Green emitted a pulse that slowed time, making Red Boy's movements sluggish, as if moving through underwater syrup.

"Temporal dilation," the Green Head announced. "Movement restricted to 10%."

The net closed in. Red Boy slashed at it, but his spear moved too slowly. The wires cut into his armor, biting deep into his flesh.

"Pain is a signal," the Hound intoned. "Submit."

Red Boy roared, his fury spiking. The Shadow Flame responded to his rage. It didn't speed him up; it *ate the time* around him. The seconds that held him back were consumed, leaving a void where cause and effect collapsed.

He "glitched" forward, skipping the intervening space, appearing directly on the Green Head's snout.

"Submit this!"

He drove the spear down through the mask. The Green Head exploded into green sparks. Time snapped back to normal with a deafening crack.

Seven heads left.

But the Hound was learning. The remaining heads backed away, forming a circle. Their eyes glowed in unison, their energies linking together to form a complex, multi-layered barrier.

"Adaptive defense matrix active," the Hound chattered. "Void signature analyzed. Counter-frequency generating."

A wave of white light washed over Red Boy. It didn't burn; it *purified*. It tried to wash the Shadow Flame out of his system, to reset him to his factory settings. To make him just a boy again.

"No!" Red Boy screamed, clutching his head. The memories he had sacrificed tried to return. His mother's face. His father's voice. They were weapons now, used to weaken his resolve.

*They are trying to save you,* the Prince mocked. *Disgusting, isn't it?*

"I don't want to be saved!" Red Boy yelled basically tearing at his own chest to keep the darkness in. "I want to win!"

He channeled every ounce of his hatred into the spear. The weapon turned pitch black, absorbing all light in the dimension.

He wasn't fighting a beast anymore. He was fighting the very concept of rehabilitation.
