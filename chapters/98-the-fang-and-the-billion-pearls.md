# Chapter 98: The Fang and the Billion Pearls

Three days later, the seas were calm. The Crystal Palace shone with a brightness it hadn't known in centuries.

Wukong sat on a coral ledge, looking out at the schools of cyber-fish swimming past. He felt unbalanced. For thousands of years, the weight of the Golden Staff had been a part of him. Now, he felt like a bird without a beak.

"Great Sage," Dragon King Ao Guang approached him. He looked younger, the stress lines gone from his face. But he walked with a slight limp, and his jaw was bandaged.

"Old Ao," Wukong nodded. "How's the toothache?"

"A small price," Ao Guang touched his jaw. "Come. It is ready."

He led Wukong to the Grand Forge. It was a massive chamber powered by volcanic vents. In the center, suspended in a zero-gravity field, was a weapon.

It was a staff, but not like his old one.

The core was made from Ao Guang's own Ancestral Fang—a material harder than diamond, sharper than a laser.

But it was the coating that took Wukong's breath away.

"We called for a tithe," Ao Guang explained softly. "Every dragon, every sea-beast, every citizen who could spare one. They gave us their Pearls."

The staff was encrusted with millions of microscopic Dragon Pearls. They weren't just glued on; they were fused into the molecular lattice of the fang by Tianji's nanobots.

The result was a weapon that shimmered like the Milky Way. It wasn't gold. It was iridescent white, flowing with an inner light that shifted from blue to violet to silver.

"One hundred million pearls," Ao Guang said. "Each one contains a sliver of gratitude. A fragment of a soul."

Tianji stepped forward, holding a tablet. "I also integrated a kinetic-feedback loop. The pearls act as capacitors. The harder you hit, the more energy they store. And because of the non-linear geometry of the Fang..."

"It can cut space," Wukong finished, walking up to it.

He reached out. The staff hummed. Not the heavy, aggressive growl of his old iron bar. This was a high-pitched, singing tone. A dragon's roar.

He grabbed it.

**FLASH.**

A pulse of white light exploded from the forge, turning the ocean transparent for a split second.

Wukong spun the staff. It was lighter than the Golden Staff, faster. It moved like water, fluid and unstoppable. He slammed it on the anvil.

The anvil didn't break. It vanished. Disintegrated into atomic dust.

"Whoa," Bajie stepped back, eyes wide. "That's... sharp."

"The Dragon Tooth Staff," Wukong whispered. He felt the wills of a hundred million dragons flowing into his arm. It wasn't just a weapon. It was an army.

He bowed deeply to Ao Guang.

"Thank you, Old Neighbor," Wukong said, his voice thick with emotion. "I will carry your people with me."

"It is we who thank you, Great Sage," Ao Guang bowed back. "The Sea is calm because of you."
