# Chapter 57: The Sleeping Cloud

The Nimbus was small for a starship, barely larger than a fighter jet, but its design was radically different from the brutalist industrial aesthetic of the surrounding wreckage. It had no visible seams, no rivets, no sharp angles. It lay on the launch deck like a drop of mercury frozen in time.

"Nanofluidic Hull," Sentry-7 analyzed, walking around the craft with reverence. "Self-repairing smart-matter. Variable geometry wings. This is peak Coalition technology. How did it survive here?"

"It was waiting," Little Stone said. He walked up to the ship and placed his hand on the smooth, white surface.

The ship rippled.

A pulse of soft blue light traveled from under his palm, spreading across the fuselage. The cockpit canopy, which looked like opaque glass, dissolved into mist, revealing the interior.

There was only one pilot seat. It was surrounded by a halo of neural interface needles.

"Warning," Sentry-7 said sharply. "Do not enter. That is a Direct Neural Interface (DNI). Level 5. It connects the pilot's brainstem directly to the ship's reactor core."

"So?" Little Stone asked, climbing onto the wing.

"So, the mortality rate for test pilots was 100%," the robot explained. "The sensory data overload fries the human nervous system in seconds. It requires a mind capable of processing petabytes of telemetry instantly."

"It won't hurt me," Little Stone said with strange certainty. He hopped into the cockpit.

"Stone, wait!" Tang Seng moved forward, but it was too late.

The mist-canopy reformed, sealing the boy inside.

Inside the cockpit, there were no joysticks, no buttons, no screens. Just the seat and the needles. As Little Stone sat back, the needles extended. They didn't pierce his skin; they stopped vivid millimeters away and arc lightning jumped the gap.

*LINK ESTABLISHED.*

The voice didn't come from speakers. It echoed directly inside his skull. It wasn't the cold, robotic voice of the Facility AI. This voice was wind. It was speed. It was freedom.

*PILOT IDENTIFIED: UNKNOWN. GENETIC MATCH: 99.9% COMPATIBLE. WELCOME BACK.*

"I'm not back," Little Stone thought. "I'm new."

*ADAPTING... SYNCHRONIZATION COMPLETE.*

Suddenly, Little Stone *was* the ship.

He felt the fuel lines like veins. He felt the fusion reactor purring in his chest. He felt the sensors extending outward like whiskers, tasting the air of the hangar. He could see the dust motes dancing in 360 degrees. He could feel the weight of Sentry-7 standing on the deck.

Outside, the ship transformed. The white hull shifted, spikes retracting, wings extending. The landing gear lifted the craft off the deck, hovering silently on a cushion of gravimetric waves.

"He... he is doing it," Ao Lie gasped. "He's flying it with his mind."

The canopy mist thinned, showing Little Stone's face. He wasn't screaming in pain. He was laughing.

"It tickles!" his voice boomed over the ship's external speakers. "It feels like... like a somersault!"

"Master," Sentry-7 said, its optical sensor widening. "I am detecting a massive seismic event. The activation of the Nimbus's core has attracted attention."

The floor of the hangar shook. The rusted bulkheads groaned.

From the dark abyss of the ship's elevator shaft—a hole leading deep into the bowels of the dead dreadnought—a sound emerged. It was a mechanical shriek, deeper and louder than the Rust Lords.

"Something big is waking up," Ao Lie said, drawing his sword.

"The Guardian," Sentry-7 said. "The dreadnought's automated defense system. It has been dormant for centuries, but the energy signature of a Coalition prototype just triggered its 'Kill on Sight' protocol."

The floor plates in the center of the hangar exploded upward.

A metallic worm, twenty meters wide and covered in rotating drilling teeth, erupted from the ground. Its "head" was a single, massive laser array.

"Stone!" Tang Seng shouted at the hovering ship. "We have company!"

Little Stone looked down through the ship's sensors. He felt the ship's weapons systems coming online—plasma cannons, quantum missiles, shielding.

"Don't worry, Teacher," Little Stone said, his voice echoing with the power of the machine. "I'll take you for a ride."

The Nimbus dipped its nose, its engines glowing a fierce, bright blue. It was no longer just a ship. It was the Cloud, and the Monkey was finally in the sky.
