# Chapter 71: Scars on the Crystal

The *Red Armillary* dropped out of hyperspace, its heat shields glowing cherry-red. Nezha deactivated the singularity drive and looked out the viewport.

Kunlun Station—the Celestial Archive—usually shone like a diamond suspended in the black velvet of space. It was a massive dodecahedron of crystalline data-stacks, orbiting the center of the galactic information network.

Now, it looked like a bitten apple.

A massive, perfectly spherical chunk of the station was simply... gone. There was no debris field. No floating twisted metal. No venting gas. Just a clean, absolute absence where structure used to be. The edges of the wound weren't melted or torn; they ended in pixelated static, as if the universe itself was failing to render the object.

"By the Jade Emperor..." Nezha whispered.

He had seen destruction. He was the God of War, after all. He had seen planets glassed by orbital bombardment and stars collapse into pulsars. But he had never seen *nothingness*.

"Docking procedure initiated," the ship's AI announced, its voice calm despite the visual horror. "Warning: Station integrity at 42%. Gravitational anomalies detected."

Nezha docked at an emergency port that hadn't been erased. He grabbed his Fire-tipped Spear and kicked the hatch open.

The air inside the station tasted of ozone and static electricity. The lights flickered in a pattern that made his eyes ache—a strobing effect caused by localized time dilation.

"Tianji!" Nezha’s voice amplified by his helmet speakers.

He floated through the corridors. The gravity plating was malfunctioning, shifting vector every few meters. One moment he was walking on the floor, the next he was falling toward a wall.

He found the Librarian in the main data atrium. Or what was left of it.

Tianji sat on a floating platform, surrounded by holographic screens that were bleeding code like open wounds. The old scholar looked terrified. His usually immaculate robes were torn, and his eyes darted around the empty space as if expecting the darkness to bite.

"Report," Nezha landed in front of him, the metal soles of his boots clanging on the platform.

Tianji flinched. "Third Prince. You're late."

"I got here as fast as physics allowed," Nezha snapped. He gestured to the massive void in the station's hull. "Who did this? Report."

"The Boy," Tianji whispered. "Red Boy. But it wasn't him. It was... the shadow behind him."

"Shadow?"

"The Prince of Night. The Entropy." Tianji shivered. "They didn't use weapons, Nezha. They used a command prompt. They executed a delete function on reality."

Nezha walked to the edge of the platform and looked into the abyss. The missing section of the station went down for miles. He extended a hand toward the emptiness.

His fingertips tingled. His armor's proximity warmers screamed. *Warning: Null-space detected. Existential threat.*

"He corrupted the Samadhi Fire," Nezha realized. "He mixed it with the Void."

" It is a fire that burns history," Tianji said. "He came for the coordinates."

Nezha spun around. "Coordinates? For what?"

"For the Monkey," Tianji said. "He forced me to decrypt the trajectory of Wukong's escape pod. He knows where the pilgrims are."

Nezha gripped his spear. "Give me the vector."

"It's too late," Tianji shook his head. "He has a head start. And with that power... Nezha, you cannot fight him. Not with conventional weapons. He will unmake you."

Nezha laughed. It was a sharp, brittle sound.

"Unmake me?" He activated his Armillary Sash. The red ribbon elongated, swirling around him like a dragon made of hard-light. "I was made from a lotus flower and dragon bones. I have died before, Librarian. It didn’t stick."

He pulled a data-jack from his wrist and plugged it into Tianji’s console. "Download the vector. Now."

Tianji hesitated, then typed the command. "Vector transferred. System: 81-X. Planet named 'Yellow Wind Ridge'."

"Yellow Wind Ridge," Nezha repeated. "Sounds dusty."

He retracted the jack and turned back to the airlock.

"Nezha," Tianji called out.

The Prince stopped.

"Be careful," the Librarian warned. "The Red Boy you knew is dead. What occupies his skin is something much older."

"Good," Nezha smirked, though for the first time in centuries, his heart was beating a little faster. "I hate fighting children."

He launched himself down the corridor, transforming into a blur of red light. The hunt was on.
