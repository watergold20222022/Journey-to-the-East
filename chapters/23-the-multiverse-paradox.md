On the other side of the invisible wall, the silence was deafening.

Sun Wukong stood in the exact center of the crystal clearing. His golden eyes burned with an intensity that could melt steel, but here, they only reflected the cold, unmoving facets of the quartz pillars.

He felt him.

It wasn't a sound, or a smell, or a sight. It was a vibration in the marrow of his bones. A resonance that hummed in the frequency of brotherhood. *Bajie is here.*

"Bajie!" Wukong roared. The soundwave shattered a nearby crystal formation, sending shards tinkling to the ground like frozen rain. "Idiot! Where are you hiding?"

He spun around, his cape whipping the air. He swung the Golden Staff—the *real* one, heavy and thrumming with power—through the empty space. It passed through nothingness. There was no resistance, no clang of metal on metal, no joyous reunion.

Just the empty wind of a dead planet.

Wukong dropped to one knee, panting. The connection was so strong he could almost smell the ozone of Bajie's rake. "I can feel you, you fat fool," he whispered to the dust. "Why can't I see you?"

For the first time in centuries, the Monkey King felt truly small. He was trapped in a prison without bars, isolated in a universe that refused to acknowledge his existence. He was the Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, yet he couldn't bridge the gap of a single meter.

"It is a question of harmonics," Tianji said, his voice overlapping with the wind on the other side of the divide.

Bajie, Alice, and the robot stood in the same clearing, but their world was slightly different. Here, the crystals were intact, glowing with a soft internal light.

Tianji projected a complex holographic model into the air. It showed two sine waves, almost identical, but slightly offset. They rippled parallel to each other, never touching.

"We are here," Tianji pointed to the blue wave. "Sun Wukong is here," he pointed to the red wave. "Spatially, our coordinates are identical: Latitude 45.3, Longitude 112.8 on Planet Kunlun. However, temporally, we are displaced."

"Time travel?" Alice asked, her brow furrowed. "We're in the future?"

"No," Tianji corrected. "We are in a different probability. This is the nature of the Multiverse. Every quantum decision creates a branching path. In one branch, this planet is dead. In another, it is alive. We are standing on the branch where the timeline stabilized. Wukong is trapped in a branch where... it did not."

Bajie stared at the hologram. "So he's real. He's right here. But he's in a unexpected ghost world?"

"A divergent timeline," Tianji said. "Physics suggests these lines never cross. They run parallel until entropy dissolves them. To cross from one to the other would require an energy source capable of collapsing the quantum wave function of an entire planet."

"Which is impossible," Alice finished, looking defeated.

"Current technological archives indicate zero probability of success," Tianji agreed. "I have scanned the databases of the Human Federation, the Beast-Man Empire, and the ancient stored data in my own core. There is no machine capable of bridging a multiverse divergence."

Bajie gripped his rake. He looked at the empty space where, unbeknownst to him, his brother was kneeling. "So that's it? We go home?"

There was a long silence. The wind howled through the crystal spires.

"No," Alice said softly.

Tianji tilted his head. "My analysis is 99.999% accurate."

"Your analysis is based on machines," Alice said, stepping forward. Her eyes were bright with an idea. "But we aren't just machines. Tianji, you said you felt a 'mass shadow.' Bajie, you said you felt a 'resonance.' The Master's diary was vibrating."

She pointed at the book tucked in Bajie's belt. It wasn't just vibrating now; it was glowing with a faint, warm light.

"If the universes are truly separate," Alice argued, her voice gaining strength, "then *nothing* should cross over. No gravity, no light, no information. But we *felt* him. Wukong is signaling us. Information is crossing the barrier!"

Tianji paused. The lights on his chassis cycled rapidly as he processed the logic. "If a signal can cross... a channel exists."

"Exactly," Alice nodded. "It might be microscopic. A quantum tunnel. A wormhole the size of an atom. But if it's there, we can widen it. We don't need to collapse the wave function of the whole planet. We just need to open a door."

Bajie looked at Alice, a grin slowly spreading across his porcine features. "You're saying we can dig a hole."

"I'm saying we can build a bridge," Alice smiled.

"Illogical," Tianji stated, though his tone held a note of curiosity his programming shouldn't have allowed. "But... statistically intriguing. If we can isolate the frequency of the resonance, we might be able to amplify it. We could create a localized harmonic feedback loop."

"Like a microphone next to a speaker," Bajie said. "Make it scream until the glass breaks."

Tianji looked at Bajie. "A crude analogy. But accurately descriptive."

"Then let's do it," Bajie said. He slammed his rake into the ground. "We're not leaving until we break the sky."

While the trio on the *Sky Rake* began to feverishly calculate, stripping parts from the ship to build a theoretical 'Resonance Amplifier,' Wukong remained alone.

He sat in the lotus position, eyes closed, extending his senses to their absolute limit. He didn't know about quantum mechanics or wave functions. He only knew one thing.

His brother had come for him. And Wukong would not let a little thing like the fabric of reality keep them apart. He began to chant, a low, guttural sound that matched the vibration in his bones, waiting for the answering call.
