# Chapter 108: The Wrath of the Lotus

The attack didn't come from the outside.

One moment, Nezha was kilometers away. The next, a ribbon of red light—the *Huntian Ling*—phased through the ship's Void Shields as if they didn't exist.

The red sash materialized inside the main corridor of the *Silent Night*. It wasn't fabric; it was a manifestation of binding laws. It lashed out like a viper.

"Engaging hostiles!" Bulwark roared. He activated his thrusters, charging down the hallway. His Fusion Hammer glowed white-hot, capable of smashing a tank into foil.

He swung.

The red sash moved faster than sensors could track. It wrapped around the hammer, then around Bulwark's arm, then his throat.

"System error. Mobility restricted," the suit's AI chirped.

"Get off!" Bulwark fired his shoulder-mounted plasma cannons. The plasma splashed harmlessly against the red sash.

Nezha stepped out of the shadows. He looked small compared to the mechanical giant, but his presence filled the hallway with suffocating pressure.

"Advanced alloy," Nezha noted, tapping Bulwark’s chest plate. "But no soul."

He flicked his wrist. The sash tightened. The neutronium alloy of the suit groaned, then buckled. Bulwark screamed as his invincible armor was crushed like a soda can. Nezha tossed the crumpled mass aside—Bulwark was alive, but incapacitated, trapped in his own broken shell.

On the bridge, Kain watched the feeds die one by one.

"Vent the atmosphere!" Kain ordered. "Flush him out!"

The airlocks opened. The ship became a vacuum. Nezha didn't even blink. He walked through the depressurized ship, his Wind Fire Wheels leaving scorched footprints on the deck.

He reached the Cargo Bay, where the *Dimension-Lock Chains* were stored—the weapons Pangu had built to hold Wukong.

"Trash," Nezha spat. He swept his spear. The divine weapon, burning with the True Fire of Samadhi, sliced through the container. The high-tech chains melted into slag.

The door to the bridge melted. Kain drew his vibro-blade, standing over the sobbing, traumatized Siren.

Nezha floated in. His eyes were burning gold, scanning the crew.

"You are nothing," Nezha said, his voice bored. "Tell your master... tell Pangu..."

Nezha floated closer, until the tip of his spear hovered an inch from Kain's cybernetic eye.

"...that the Monkey King is *my* prey. If anyone is going to defeat him, it will be the Third Prince of the Lotus. If I see your tin cans in this sector again, I will burn your 'Apotheosis' to ash."

Nezha spun around. He threw a small golden ring—the *Universal Ring*. It bounced around the room, smashing every navigation console, every sensor, and the main hyperdrive core.

The ship lurched, dead in the water.

"You have backup power," Nezha said over his shoulder as he walked toward a hull breach he had just made. "Crawl back home. It should take you... forty years at sub-light speed. Plenty of time to think."

With a flash of red light, he was gone.

Kain dropped his sword. The mission was a total loss. They hadn't even reached the black hole, and they had been dismantled by a myth they refused to believe in.
