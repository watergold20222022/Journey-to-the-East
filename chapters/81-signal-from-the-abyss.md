# Chapter 81: Signal from the Abyss

The silence on Planet Lament was heavier than the smog.

The factories had stopped screaming. The turbines were cold. But the silence was filled with millions of smaller sounds—the coughing of sick children, the crying of infants, and the terrified whispers of survivors who didn't know if they were truly safe.

Nezha sat on the edge of the King’s destroyed throne, running a diagnostic on his internal chronometer.

"Two million, four hundred thousand, and sixty-two," Red Boy said, walking into the room. He was carrying a crate of nutrient paste he had found in a warehouse.

"Casualties?" Nezha asked.

"Survivors," Red Boy corrected. He dropped the crate. "We have too many mouths. The nutrient reserves will last three days. The water filtration system is running at 15%."

Nezha rubbed his temples. "I'm a General, not a babysitter. My logistics algorithms are for moving battalions, not feeding toddlers."

"If they starve, we saved them for nothing," Red Boy pointed out. He sat down, looking tired. The Void veins on his neck had receded, but he was still pale.

Nezha looked at the massive communications array on the factory roof. It was a high-gain transmitter, used by the King to coordinate his harvesting fleets.

"We need evac," Nezha said. "We need a fleet."

"The Heavenly Navy?" Red Boy raised an eyebrow. "If you call them, they will arrest me. And probably glass the planet to cover up the mess."

"No," Nezha shook his head. "Heaven is too bureaucratic. We need someone who actually cares about 'humanitarian aid'. Someone neutral."

" The Galactic Guard," Red Boy muttered. "The do-gooders of the outer rim."

"Exactly," Nezha stood up. "They have hospital ships. Food replicators. Therapists."

He flew up to the control console of the array. It was smashed, but the core processor was intact.

"I can hack the frequency," Nezha said, his fingers flying across the holographic interface. "But the encryption key is bio-locked to the King."

"Move," Red Boy said.

He stepped up to the console. He placed his hand on the bio-scanner.

*Samadhi Void: Simulate.*

The black fire on his palm shifted, mimicking the exact bio-signature of the dead King. The scanner beeped green.

"Access Granted," the computer chirped.

Nezha looked at him, impressed. "You can mimic souls?"

"I ate him," Red Boy shrugged. "I remember his taste."

Nezha shuddered slightly but didn't comment. He typed in the SOS code.

"Priority Alpha. This is... an anonymous concerned citizen. Sector 81-X. Planet Lament. Massive humanitarian crisis. Two million refugees. Requesting immediate medical and transport support."

He hit send.

A pulse of high-frequency energy shot up from the tower, piercing the smog and racing into the dark void.

"Signal sent," Nezha monitored the readout. "Nearest Guard outpost is in the Sagittarius Arm. Relativistic delay... they'll be here in three weeks."

"Three weeks," Red Boy looked at the sea of children below. "A lot can happen in three weeks. Slavers. Scavengers. Hunger."

"Then we get to work," Nezha summoned his spear, but this time he set it to 'low output'—a welding torch mode. "We fix the water. We fortify the perimeter. We make sure they survive until the bus gets here."

Red Boy looked at his own hands—hands that had only ever destroyed.

"I don't know how to fix things," he admitted.

"You're a fast learner," Nezha tossed him a wrench. "Start with the heating grid. If the temperature drops tonight, the little ones freeze."

Red Boy caught the wrench. He weighed it in his hand, then looked at the frozen pipes.

"Fine," the Prince of Night grumbled. "But I'm not changing any diapers."
