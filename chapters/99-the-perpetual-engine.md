# Chapter 99: The Perpetual Engine

The celebration feast was grand, featuring delicacies harvested from the deepest trenches: electric eels braised in plasma sauce, giant kelp salads, and wine aged in pressure chambers. But Tianji was notably absent.

Wukong found him in the Engineering Bay of the Crystal Palace, surrounded by Dragon scientists who were listening to him with rapt attention.

"The core is stable," Tianji was saying, pointing to a blueprint floating in the air. "But stability is not sustainability. You cannot drill the planet again."

"But without the geothermal energy," a Chief Engineer argued, his gills fluttering nervously, "our cities will go dark in a decade. We cannot regress to chemical burning."

"You don't need to burn anything," Tianji swiped the hologram. "Look around you. You live in a giant battery."

He displayed a model of the planet's oceans.

"The moon, Crateris, exerts a constant gravitational pull. The tides move trillions of tons of water every six hours. That is kinetic energy on a planetary scale."

"We tried tidal generators," the engineer dismissed. "Too inefficient."

"Not just tidal," Tianji corrected. "Resonance. By placing piezoelectric crystal arrays—grown from the same material as your coral towers—in key fault lines, you can convert the tidal pressure directly into cold fusion ignition."

"Cold fusion?" Ao Guang walked in, holding a goblet of wine. "We have sought that technology for eons. It has always been unstable."

"Because you tried to force it," Tianji said. "Fusion requires harmony, not force. The ocean breathes. If you time the reaction to the planet's own heartbeat... it becomes self-sustaining."

Ao Guang looked at the blueprints. He looked at the young engineers, whose eyes were shining with hope.

"A Perpetual Engine," Tianji concluded. "Clean. Infinite. And it heals the planet instead of hurting it."

"You give us too much, Scholar," Ao Guang said, placing a hand on Tianji's metallic shoulder. "First our lives, now our future."

"It is logical," Tianji stated simply. "A stable civilization is less likely to produce chaos. And... I have grown fond of the fish."

The next morning, the *Sky Rake* was ready.

The hull was repaired with dragon-scale nano-weave. The fuel tanks were full of refined heavy water. And the pantry was stocked with dried squid (much to Bajie's delight).

The entire population of the capital city came to see them off. Millions of dragons swam in formation, creating a living tunnel of light leading to the surface.

Wukong stood on the ramp, the Dragon Tooth Staff strapped to his back. It felt different, but good. Like wearing a new pair of boots that you knew would last a thousand miles.

"Take care of the place, Old Ao," Wukong shouted. "And don't drill any more holes!"

"Go with the tide, Great Sage!" Ao Guang waved his trident. "The Dragon Race will never forget!"

The *Sky Rake* engaged its engines. This time, it didn't just fly; it surged, powered by the new efficient fuel cells Tianji had installed.

They broke the surface of the ocean, shooting up into the blue sky, leaving a rainbow spray behind them.

"Next stop?" Bajie asked, chewing on a piece of kelp jerky.

Tianji checked the navigation computer. "The trail of the Lotus Prince is refreshing. He has stopped moving."

"Stopped?" Wukong asked.

"Yes. In Sector 10. A station called 'Little Thunder Monastery'."

Wukong's eyes narrowed. "Little Thunder, huh? That sounds... ominous."

He patted his new staff.

"Let's go say hello."
