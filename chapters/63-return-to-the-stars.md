# Chapter 63: Return to the Stars

Space tore open.

It wasn't a clean wormhole or a stable warp gate. It was a jagged wound, spilling purple smoke and gravitational distortion into the vacuum of Sector 9.

From the fissure, Red Boy emerged.

He didn't need a ship. The void energy he had absorbed formed a personal atmosphere around him, a shell of magnetized darkness that protected him from the cold and radiation. He floated, taking his first breath of real matter in what felt like eons.

"I am back," he whispered. His voice carried in the vacuum, transmitted by the Shadow Flame to the surrounding ether.

The stars looked different. Colder. Sharper.

A shadow fell over him.

He looked up. A ship was decloaking in front of him. It was a massive, sharp-edged vessel, black as obsidian, with no visible engines or windows. It looked like a dagger carved from the night sky itself.

*Welcome back to the board, Pawn,* the Prince of Night's voice spoke from the ship's comms, echoing directly in Red Boy's mind.

"I am no pawn," Red Boy sneered, his eyes flashing violet. "I am a King."

*We shall see,* the Prince replied, amused. *You have broken the cage, but you are naked. You need armor. You need weapons that can channel your new 'gifts'.*

A hangar bay on the black ship opened. It wasn't lit by guide lights, but by bioluminescent fungi that pulsed with a slow, hypnotic rhythm.

Red Boy drifted inside.

The interior of the ship—*The Eclipse Vanguard*—was a cathedral to entropy. Droids that looked like skeletons serviced the dark machinery.

He landed on the deck. A group of acolytes in hooded robes approached him. They didn't speak. They knelt, offering him a new set of armor.

It was matte black, forged from neutron star density material, etched with runes that hurt to look at.

Red Boy stripped off his damaged, high-tech flight suit—the one Guanyin's technology had built—and let it drop to the floor. He donned the black armor. It fused to his skin, cold and biting.

"Perfect," he said. He summoned his spear. The weapon warped, shedding its old form to match his new aesthetic. The Samadhi Spear was gone. The Void Spear was born.

*Do you feel it?* the Prince asked.

"I feel... him," Red Boy said. He closed his eyes.

He reached out with his senses, not looking for heat or light, but for the specific signature of a soul he hated more than anything in the universe.

He felt a faint pulse. Far away. To the East.

It was weak, like a candle in a hurricane. But it was there. And next to it... something else. A Dragon. A Monk. And... a ship?

"He has allies," Red Boy said, opening his eyes. A cruel smile split his face. "Old friends."

*The Monkey King has been... diminished,* the Prince revealed. *He has been rebooted. A child. Heavy shackles. He does not remember the mountain.*

"He doesn't remember?" Red Boy's smile faded, replaced by cold fury. "He doesn't remember humiliated me? He doesn't remember taking everything from me?"

*No.*

"Then I will remind him," Red Boy hissed. "I will carve the memory into his bones."

He walked towards the command chair of the hangar's strike craft—a swift, black interceptor that looked like a severed hand.

"Where are you going?" the Prince asked.

"To the East," Red Boy said, engines igniting with a roar of violet flame. "To the teacher. To the dragon. To the stone monkey."

He blasted out of the hangar, the interceptor tearing a hole in the silence.

"I'm coming for you, Uncle," Red Boy whispered to the stars. "Ready or not."
