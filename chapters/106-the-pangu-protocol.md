# Chapter 106: The Pangu Protocol

While the Federation sought order, the Apotheosis Group sought transcendence.

Hidden inside a nebula that scrambled standard sensors, the station known as *The Crucible* hung in the void. It was a monstrosity of gothic aesthetics and hyper-tech, looking more like a cathedral than a laboratory.

In the center of the main sanctum, a massive tank of bio-luminescent fluid suspended a giant.

He was fifteen feet tall, his muscles rippling with synthetic fibers, his skin etched with glowing runes that pulsed with dark energy. He looked like an ancient god, but he was lifeless. His eyes were open, but empty.

"Failure," a voice boomed from the speakers.

The voice belonged to Pangu.

Pangu was not a man anymore. He was the station. His consciousness inhabited the central mainframe, thousands of servers dedicated to a single ego. He was the founder of the Apotheosis Group, a fanatic cult of scientists and historians who believed that the ancient myths of Earth—The Monkey King, The Nezha, The Buddha—were not stories, but historical records of beings who had achieved "Level 10 Civilization status."

"Subject 89-Gamma. The 'Hercules' prototype," a nervous technician reported, holding a datapad. "Cellular degeneration at 90%. Being unable to contain the Psionic-Dark Matter infusion."

"Dispose of it," Pangu commanded. "The flesh is weak. We need better templates."

The technician flushed the tank. The giant body dissolved into sludge.

"We have mastered the atom," Pangu mused, his avatar appearing as a hologram of a bearded giant holding an axe. "We have mastered the gene. But the 'Spark'... the Divinity... eludes us. We can build a body that can lift a mountain, but we cannot give it the soul to command the mountain."

Suddenly, the station's alarms blared. Not an attack alarm, but a 'Relic Detection' alarm.

"Report!" Pangu thundered.

"My Lord!" The technician scrambled to the console. "Our long-range passive listeners... they picked up a resonance signature. Sector 7-G. The Event Horizon."

"Show me."

The screen displayed the same data the Federation had seen, but Pangu saw it differently. He didn't see gravitational waves. He saw *Chi*.

He saw a golden aura struggling against an infinite darkness.

"That frequency..." Pangu's holographic eyes widened. "unyieldium spirit structure... chaotic neutral alignment... It cannot be."

He accessed the forbidden archives. He overlaid the signal with the theoretical signature of the Entity: *Sun Wukong*.

It was a 99.9% match.

"He is real," Pangu whispered. The hologram flickered with intense emotion. "The Great Sage is real. And he is trapped."

"Sir?" the technician asked.

"Forget the prototypes!" Pangu roared. "Why build a counterfeit god when we can capture a real one?"

"Prepare the *God-Slayer* squadron," Pangu ordered. "Equip them with the Dimension-Lock chains. Initiate the 'Heaven's Gate' protocol. We are going hunting."

"Target?"

"The Monkey King," Pangu grinned, a terrifying digital expression. "I want his body for dissection. I want his weapon for my armory. And I want his secret to immortality."

The silence of *The Crucible* was broken by the sound of engines firing. The race was on. The Federation wanted to investigate the anomaly. Pangu wanted to consume it.
