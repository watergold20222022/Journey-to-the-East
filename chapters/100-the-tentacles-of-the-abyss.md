# Chapter 100: The Tentacles of the Abyss

"Warning," Tianji's voice cut through the hum of the ship. "Gravitational shear increasing. We are approaching a Class-5 Singularity."

Wukong looked out the viewport. The stars were gone. In their place was a disk of swirling light, an accretion disk burning with the heat of a million dying suns. And in the center, a hole in the universe. A black so absolute it hurt to look at.

"The Maw of Kara," Tianji identified. "A supermassive black hole. Navigational hazard extremis."

"We're not going in, are we?" Bajie asked, clutching his seatbelt. "Please tell me the Lotus Prince didn't fly into *that*."

"His trail skirts the edge," Tianji said. "But... I am detecting another signal. distress beacon. Biological."

"Biological?" Wukong unbuckled. "Show me."

Tianji magnified the image. Hovering perilously close to the event horizon was a small, rocky planet. It looked grey and dead, but clinging to its surface was a nightmare.

It was a creature the size of a continent. A Void Kraken. Its bulbous, black body pulsed with dark energy. Thousands of massive tentacles were buried deep into the planet's crust, throbbing as they sucked the geothermal lifeblood out of the world.

"It's feeding," Wukong whispered. "It's eating the planet."

"Magnifying surface," Tianji said.

The screen showed the ground. Amidst the cracking earth and lava flows, Wukong saw movement. Small, hairy creatures running on two legs, carrying crude stone spears, looking up at the sky in terror. They were huddled in caves, shielding their young from the falling ash.

" Monkeys," Wukong's breath hitched. "They look like... us."

"Technically, they are Proto-Hominids," Tianji corrected. "Stone Age intelligence. They are doomed. The planet's structural integrity is at 12%. When the Kraken finishes feeding, the husk will fall into the black hole."

"We have to help them," Wukong said instantly. He grabbed his Dragon Tooth Staff.

"Are you crazy?" Bajie jumped up. "Look at the gravity readings! That monster is anchoring the planet. If you attack it, the gravity well will snag us. We'll be spaghettified!"

"We can't just watch them die, Pig!" Wukong snarled. "They're innocent!"

"The universe is full of dying things, Monkey!" Bajie shouted back. "We have a mission! We need to find the Master! We can't save every bug on the windshield!"

Wukong stared at the screen. He saw a mother ape holding her baby, cowering as a tentacle smashed a nearby mountain.

"I can," Wukong said, his voice low and dangerous. "That's why I'm the Great Sage."

He turned to the airlock.

"Tianji, keep the ship at a safe distance. Bajie, gear up. We're going down."

"I hate you," Bajie groaned, but he was already reaching for his rake. "I really, really hate you."

"I know," Wukong grinned, the Dragon Tooth Staff glowing white in his hand. "Let's go slay a monster."
