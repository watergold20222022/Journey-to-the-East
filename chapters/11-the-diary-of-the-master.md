The journey to the Genetic Archive was not what Zhu Bajie had expected. He had anticipated a high-security government facility, a gleaming spire in the center of the Beast-Man Metropolis. Instead, Tybalt led them away from the city lights, down into the subterranean depths of the planet's crust, through a maze of abandoned service tunnels that smelled of rust and old water.

"The Archive isn't a library in the way you think," Tybalt grunted, his injured arm bound in a makeshift sling. He moved with a limp but kept a steady pace. "It's a tomb. A relic from before the Great Uplift. Before my kind ruled this world."

Alice kept her hand near her holster, her eyes scanning the shadows. "You mean it's human?"

"Human," Tybalt confirmed, spitting the word out like a curse. "The original masters. They built deep. They built to last. When the rebellion happened, they sealed their most precious data down here. We found it centuries ago, but most of it is encrypted or useless. Except for the physical artifacts."

They arrived at a massive blast door, covered in centuries of grime and graffiti. Tybalt keyed a sequence into a hidden panel he pried open with his claws. The ancient mechanism groaned, hydraulic fluids hissing as the door slowly ground open.

Inside, the air was stale and dry, preserved by climate control systems that had been running on geothermal power for a millennium. The lights flickered on, revealing a sprawling complex of glass and steel. It was a laboratory, frozen in time. Skeletons of long-dead humans lay where they had fallen, still wearing white coats that had turned to dust.

"Don't touch anything," Tybalt warned. "Security bots might still be active on the lower levels. We need the Archives. Sector 4."

They moved through the silent corridors. Bajie looked around with a mix of curiosity and sorrow. This place reminded him of the celestial palaces in their decline, or the ruins of civilizations he had seen on his journey to the West—the *original* journey. The technology here was advanced, perhaps even more so than what the Beast-Men currently used, but it lacked the organic, chaotic vitality of the city above.

"Here," Tybalt said, stopping before a room labeled *Cultural Preservation & Analysis*.

The door slid open with a smooth hum, unlike the outer blast door. Inside, rows of shelves were lined not with data crystals or holographic emitters, but with books. Actual, physical books made of paper and binding.

"Paper," Alice whispered, reaching out to touch a spine. "I've only seen these in museums. They're worth a fortune."

"These are the originals," Tybalt said, leaning against a desk. "The humans brought them from Earth. They were obsessed with their history, their stories. They thought if they taught us their culture, we would be more like them. More... civilized."

Bajie ignored them. He felt a pull, a magnetic resonance that tugged at his very soul. It wasn't magic, not in the way he knew it, but a spiritual gravity. He walked past rows of encyclopedias and technical manuals, his footsteps echoing on the tile floor.

He stopped in front of a glass display case in the center of the room. Inside, resting on a velvet cushion, was a thick, leather-bound volume. The cover was worn, the leather cracked with age, but the gold lettering was still legible.

It was written in Traditional Chinese characters.

*Xi You Ji*. Journey to the West.

"That's it," Tybalt said, nodding at the case. "The book I told you about. The one with the pig-man."

Bajie didn't wait. He smashed the glass with his rake. The alarm didn't sound; the system was too old or too dead to care. He reached in and lifted the book. It was heavy, heavier than paper should be.

He opened it.

He expected to see printed type, the standardized font of a mass-produced novel. He expected to read the flowery prose of Wu Cheng'en, the storyteller who had made their suffering into entertainment for the masses.

Instead, he saw handwriting.

Elegant, meticulous brushstrokes. Ink that had faded to brown but retained the sharpness of the hand that wrote it.

*Day 1. The Emperor has granted me the mandate. I leave Chang'an with a heavy heart but a clear purpose. The road to the West is long, and I fear I am not strong enough.*

Bajie's hands trembled. He turned the page.

*Day 45. I met a monkey today. He was trapped under a mountain. He is wild, uncouth, and violent. But he called me Master.*

He flipped further, his breath catching in his throat.

*Day 108. We have arrived at Gao Village. The villagers speak of a monster, a pig-demon who has taken a wife. I must confront him. I hope he can be reasoned with.*

"This..." Bajie whispered, his voice cracking. "This is not a story."

Alice stepped closer, looking over his shoulder. "What does it say? I can't read those symbols."

"It is not a novel," Bajie said, tears welling in his porcine eyes. He ran a finger over the ink. He could feel the pressure of the brush, the hesitation in the strokes where the writer had paused to think. "It is a diary. A biography."

He looked up at Alice, his expression raw. "It is my Master's handwriting. Tang Seng. Tripitaka. This is his journal."

"Your master?" Tybalt scoffed. "The monk? He's been dead for thousands of years, pig. That book is just an artifact."

"No," Bajie said firmly. He clutched the book to his chest. He could feel a faint warmth radiating from it, a psychic residue left behind by the holy monk. It was faint, like a dying ember in a blizzard, but it was there. "He was here. Or this book was brought here by someone who knew him. This isn't just paper. It's a link."

He closed his eyes, focusing on that warmth. He tried to reach out with his senses, to trace the thread of spiritual energy back to its source. For a moment, he saw a flash of an image—a golden peak, a swirling vortex of stars, and a gentle hand reaching out.

Then it was gone.

"He is out there," Bajie said, opening his eyes. The uncertainty that had plagued him since his arrival on this metallic world began to dissipate. "My Master is somewhere in this universe. This book... it is a beacon."

"So, what now?" Alice asked, crossing her arms. "We found your book. Do we sell it? Do we use it to find a map?"

"I keep it," Bajie said, tucking the heavy volume into his tunic. "I will use it to find him."

"You can't just walk out of here with that," Tybalt warned. "The Beast Council checks the inventory of the Archives every decade. They'll know it's gone."

"Let them come," Bajie said, his voice hardening. He gripped his nine-toothed rake. "I have a goal now. I am not just a refugee hiding in the mud. I am Zhu Bajie, Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy, and I am on a pilgrimage."

He looked around the ancient laboratory, at the dust and the skeletons of the humans who had tried to play god.

"But I cannot leave this planet yet," he admitted, the reality of his situation settling back in. He had no ship, no coordinates, and the signal from the book was too weak to guide him through the stars. He needed to understand how this book got here. He needed to decode the rest of the archives.

"We stay," Bajie decided. "We use this place. Tybalt, you said this was a secret lab. Does it have a functional databank?"

Tybalt hesitated, then nodded. "The mainframe is in the basement. It might still have power."

"Good," Bajie said. "We will make this our base. I will study this book, and you will help me access the human records. I need to know everything about how Earth's history ended up on this rock."

Alice sighed, but there was a small smile on her face. "Living in a creepy underground bunker with a pig-man and a traitor tiger. My mother would be so proud."

Bajie looked down at the bulge in his tunic where the diary rested. He wasn't alone anymore. The Master was with him, in words if not in flesh. And for the first time since waking up in the dumpster, Zhu Bajie felt a glimmer of hope.

The Journey to the East had truly begun.
