# Chapter 67: Ultimatum

The Bull Demon King roared, a sound that shook the dust from the ceiling. His bio-mechanical armor materialized from the nanoparticles in his blood, forming a hulking shell of bronze and steel around his body. He summoned his Iron Staff—a weapon as thick as a pillar.

"I will break your legs if I have to," the Bull vowed. "But I will not let you leave this room to die."

Red Boy didn't flinch. "Try it."

The Bull charged. The floor tiles shattered under his hooves. He swung the Iron Staff with force enough to crack a moon.

Red Boy simply raised one hand.

*BOOM.*

The staff stopped dead, caught in a palm wreathed in violet shadow. The shockwave blew out the windows and sent furniture flying.

"You're slow, old man," Red Boy whispered.

The shadow tendrils erupted from his armor, wrapping around the Iron Staff. They corroded the metal instantly, turning the legendary weapon into rust and dust in seconds.

The Bull stumbled back, staring at the crumbling remains of his weapon. "My staff... forged in the Furnace of the Eight Trigrams..."

"Obsolete," Red Boy said. He backhanded his father.

It wasn't a physical blow. It was a wave of kinetic force. The Bull Demon King, weighing five tons in his armor, was launched across the room. He smashed through the stone wall and landed in the courtyard outside.

"Bull!" Princess Iron Fan screamed.

She pulled a small, intricate device from her sleeve—the controller for the Palm Leaf Fan system. She tapped a code.

"Activate Defense Grid Alpha! Target: Red Boy!"

The terraforming towers around the palace shifted. Massive wind turbines spun up, generating a localized hurricane. The "Palm Leaf" system—a weather control array—focused its power on the courtyard.

Winds of 500 miles per hour slammed into Red Boy.

He stood in the center of the storm, his cape whipping violently. The wind was strong enough to peel armor from a tank.

"Wind," Red Boy scoffed. "You think wind can stop the Void?"

He raised his Void Spear. "Eat."

The black tip of the spear opened like a mouth. It didn't just block the wind; it *drank* it. The hurricane was sucked into the singularity, the howling gale turning into a silent vacuum.

The turbines on the towers groaned, then imploded as the pressure differential reversed.

Red Boy lowered his spear. The courtyard was silent again.

His father lay in the rubble, groaning, his armor shattered. His mother stood on the steps, the useless controller in her hand, her eyes wide with terror.

Red Boy floated up, hovering above them like a dark god.

"I could kill you," he said, his voice amplified by the armor. "I *should* kill you. It would prove that I have cut all ties."

He aimed the spear at his father's heart. The tip glowed with purple death.

Princess Iron Fan threw herself over the Bull's body. "Take me instead!"

Red Boy watched them. He felt the hunger of the Prince of Night in his mind, urging him to strike. *Do it. Make it permanent.*

But he lowered the spear.

"No," Red Boy said. "Living with your failure is a worse punishment."

He turned his back on them and walked towards his ship.

"I am going to Kunlun," he announced without looking back. "I will find Wukong. I will kill him. And then I will return to burn this garden to the ground and rebuild the Empire of Fire."

"Hong-er!" his mother cried out one last time.

The canopy of the black interceptor closed. The engines roared. Red Boy blasted into the sky, leaving his broken family—and his last chance at redemption—in the dust.
