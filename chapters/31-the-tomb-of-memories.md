Alice injected a sedative into Sha Seng's neck as Tianji worked to filter the mutagen from his blood. Slowly, the manic green light faded from the river demon's eyes, leaving them dull and haunted.

He looked up at Wukong, then at Bajie. He didn't scream this time. He just wept.

"Ghosts," Sha Seng whispered, his voice trembling. "Why do you haunt me? I buried you both deep. I put the heavy stones on top so the wolves wouldn't find you."

Wukong sat cross-legged on the ice, his tail still. "Tell us, Brother. Tell us how we died."

Sha Seng closed his eyes, and the laboratory seemed to fade, replaced by a memory of blood and snow.

"It was on the White Tiger Ridge," Sha Seng began, his voice rasping. "But not the one we knew. This one was made of metal and bone. We were crossing the Suspension Bridge of Sighs."

"The Master was hungry. You," he pointed a shaking finger at Wukong, "went to find fruit. You flew ahead. But the clouds... they weren't clouds. They were nano-swarms."

"She didn't trick us with disguises this time," Sha Seng shuddered. "No old woman. No crying daughter. Baigujing... she was the mountain itself. The swarm descended on you, Big Brother. It stripped the flesh from your bones in seconds. I saw your Golden Staff fall into the abyss. I saw your skull clatter onto the bridge."

Bajie gasped, covering his mouth. Alice looked at Wukong, who remained stone-faced.

"And me?" Bajie asked softly. "How did I go?"

"You fought," Sha Seng looked at the pig-man with a strange mixture of pity and admiration. "When the Master was taken, you went berserk. You charged into the Bone Fortress alone. You smashed the gates. But she... she used the Master's voice. She called for help from inside the shadows."

"You ran in to save him," Sha Seng whispered. "And the gates closed. I heard you scream for three days. When she finally threw your body out... you were just a husk. She had eaten your marrow."

The silence in the room was heavy enough to crush a star.

"I was the only one left," Sha Seng continued, tears carving tracks through the grime on his indigo face. "I tried to fight. But I am weak. I am just the luggage carrier. She laughed at me. She said my meat was too tough, my spirit too dull. So she made me a slave. She injected me with her poison. She made me guard the trophies of her victory."

He looked at the Golden Staff floating in the anti-gravity field. "She kept your staff as a warning. And she kept the Master... alive."

"Alive?" Wukong stood up, his eyes narrowing.

"If you can call it living," Sha Seng spat. "She keeps him in the Spire of Eternal Grief. She drains his blood every day to feed her immortality. She says his flesh is the only thing that keeps her young."

Sha Seng looked at the Wukong and Bajie standing before him. He reached out a trembling hand to touch Wukong's armor.

"You look like him," Sha Seng whispered. "But you are not him. My brother had a scar here." He touched his own temple. "And his eyes... they were always sad. Yours burn."

"We are not ghosts, Sha Seng," Wukong said gently, taking his brother's hand. "We are travelers from a place where we won. A place where the Bone Lady died."

"A different world," Sha Seng muttered, struggling to understand. "A world where I wasn't useless?"

"You were never useless," Bajie said, gripping Sha Seng's shoulder. "You were the anchor. You kept us sane."

Wukong stood up and walked to the center of the room. He looked at the Golden Staff—the relic of a dead Wukong. Then he looked at the North, toward the spire Sha Seng had mentioned.

"This Baigujing," Wukong said, his voice cold and flat. "She thinks she killed the Monkey King. She thinks she broke the Pig. She thinks she owns the Master."

He summoned his own staff—the one from his timeline—and slammed it into the ground. The ice cracked.

"She's about to find out," Wukong snarled, "that ghosts can bite back."

"Tianji," Wukong commanded. "Get him on the *Sky Rake*. Heal him. Bajie, Alice, suit up. We're going to a funeral."

"Whose?" Alice checked her weapon.

"Hers," Wukong said.
