Baigujing lay amidst the ruins of her throne, her silver robes torn, her cybernetic eye flickering with a dying light. She stared up at Wukong, not with hatred, but with a profound, terrifying confusion.

"It... cannot be," she rasped, her voice glitching. "I felt your life force extinguish. I felt the heat leave your marrow. I... I ate you."

She looked at Bajie. "And you. You screamed so loud. How? Are you clones? Holograms?"

"We are the variables you didn't calculate," Tianji said, stepping forward with scanners active. "We are from a divergent probability."

"Another world," Wukong clarified, crouching down so he was eye-level with the fallen demon. "A world where you lost."

Baigujing let out a dry, rattling laugh. "Infinite worlds... and only in one do I lose? That sounds like a lie."

"Why did you take the staff?" Wukong asked, holding up the iron rod. "You had won. You ruled the North. Why risk exposing yourself for this?"

Baigujing closed her functioning eye. "Because it haunts me."

The room grew dark as she projected a memory from her remaining neural drive.

It was a scene of chaos. The White Tiger Ridge, centuries ago. But in this memory, the sky was choked with grey clouds—nanobot swarms under her control.

"He was strong," Baigujing narrated. The projection showed a version of Wukong—the Native Wukong—fighting desperately. His armor was cracked, his cape burning. "Stronger than I expected. My skeletal warriors shattered against his skin. My illusions failed to trick his Golden Eyes."

"So I cheated," she whispered.

In the projection, the Wukong-figure raised his staff for a killing blow. But suddenly, the ground beneath him liquefied. Not magic—chemistry. Baigujing had destabilized the molecular bonds of the cliff face.

Native Wukong stumbled. In that split second, the grey clouds descended.

"The swarm," she said softly. "Billions of micro-blades. They didn't fight him. They just... erased him."

The projection showed the golden monkey screaming as he was stripped away, layer by layer. Fur, skin, muscle. In seconds, he was nothing but a falling skeleton.

"But the staff..." Baigujing’s eye twitched.

In the video, as Wukong died, his hand released the Golden Staff. It didn't decompose. It fell, heavy and glowing, plunging into the unnatural fissure Baigujing had created. It fell past the rock, past the crust, down into the planetary abyss.

"I tried to retrieve it," Baigujing said, the projection ending. "But it fell too deep. Into the crushing gravity of the planet's core. It was lost to me."

"Until I dug it up," Bajie realized.

"Yes," Baigujing looked at the pig. "Centuries of silence. And then... a pulse. A heartbeat of Divine Iron. I felt it from the Headquarters. It terrified me."

"You thought he was back," Wukong said. "You thought the ghost had climbed out of hell."

"I had to be sure," Baigujing said. "So I came for it."

She described the theft. It wasn't magic. It was biological overclocking. She had modified her own bone structure, replacing marrow with high-yield fusion cells.

"I moved between the frames of your security cameras," she murmured. "I vibrated my molecules to pass through the vault door. I grabbed the rod. It burned my hands. It rejected me. But I didn't care. I ran."

"I brought it here to study it," she gestured weakly to the stasis field. "To see if his soul was inside it. To destroy it once and for all."

She looked at Wukong again, her gaze trembling. "But I was right, wasn't I? The staff returned... and it brought the Monkey King with it."

Wukong stood up. He looked at the staff in his hand—the one that had belonged to his fallen counterpart. He felt a wave of sadness for the Wukong who had died alone, stripped to bone by a machine swarm.

"You didn't bring me back," Wukong said quietly. "You just guided me to his grave."

He turned to the others. "Secure her. And find the Master."

"Wukong," Bajie asked, looking at the captured demon. "What do we do with her? She killed... well, she killed *us*."

"We give her to Sha Seng," Wukong said grimly. "It's his story. He gets to write the ending."
