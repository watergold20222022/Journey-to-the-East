# Chapter 77: The Furnace of Souls

The mechanical claw closed around Red Boy’s ankle, lifting his limp body toward the processor intake.

"Wait," King of Inspiration purred, checking his sensor readings. "Energy spike detected. Where?"

**CLANG.**

A golden ring slammed into the mechanical arm, shearing through the titanium alloy like it was paper. The claw dropped Red Boy.

Before he hit the ground, a red blur caught him.

Nezha landed on a stack of crates, holding his rival by the collar of his armor.

"You look terrible," Nezha said to the unconscious boy. "Embarrassing."

"Who dares?" The King roared, standing up from his throne. "Another spark?"

"I am not a spark," Nezha placed Red Boy down gently, then turned to face the monster. "I am the fire that burns the house down."

He spun his Fire-tipped Spear. "Armillary Sash: Crowd Control Mode."

The red ribbon exploded from his shoulders, elongating into thousands of meters of hard-light fabric. It didn't attack the King. It wove itself around the vats, forming a cocoon around the captive children.

"Clever," the King sneered. "But fruitless."

He slammed his fist onto a control panel. "Factory Defense: Activate."

The floor plates shifted. Thousands of automated turrets rose from the ground. Lasers, plasma bolts, and sonic cannons filled the air.

Nezha grabbed Red Boy again. "Hold on, kid. This is going to be bumpy."

He ignited his Wind Fire Wheels.

Nezha didn't fight the army. He outran it. He became a streak of red lightning, weaving through the laser fire. He ran up the walls, across the ceiling pipes, dodging every shot by a millimeter.

"You run?" The King mocked. "Coward!"

"Tactical retreat!" Nezha shouted back. "There's a difference!"

He spotted an exhaust vent—a massive tunnel leading deep into the planet's crust. It was small, dangerously hot, and unmapped.

Perfect.

Nezha dove into the vent.

"Seal it!" The King ordered.

Blast doors began to close. Nezha pushed his engines to 120%. He shot through the closing gap just as the teeth of the door slammed shut, severing a piece of his sash.

They tumbled down the dark tunnel, sliding for miles until they hit a subterranean cavern. It was an old mining shaft, filled with luminescent fungi and dripping water. It was shielded by miles of rock, hiding their thermal signature.

Nezha dumped Red Boy onto the mossy ground.

"Wake up," Nezha slapped the boy's face.

Red Boy groaned. His eyes fluttered open. They were dim, the Void fire barely a flicker.

"You..." Red Boy coughed, black blood trickling from his lip. "The Prince... of Lotuses..."

"That's General to you," Nezha corrected. "And you owe me a life debt."

Red Boy tried to sit up but collapsed, clutching his chest. "Why... save me? You want... to kill me."

"I do," Nezha sat down, cleaning his spear. "But not like that. Not when you're helpless. And definitely not by that oily fish-man."

He looked at Red Boy with a mix of disdain and curiosity.

"You hesitated," Nezha said. "Back there. You had the shot. You could have erased him. But you stopped because of the shielding."

"They... were loud," Red Boy muttered, looking away. "The noise... annoyed me."

"Liar," Nezha smirked. "You care."

Red Boy scowled. "I am the Prince of Night. I care for nothing."

"Sure," Nezha stood up. "Stay here. Don't die. I'm going back."

Red Boy’s eyes widened. "He... has the Innocence Shield. You cannot... break it."

"I know," Nezha tested the edge of his spear. "But I have to try. I can't leave those kids in the jars. It's... against regulation."

"You will fail," Red Boy warned.

"Watch me," Nezha said.

He ignited his wheels and shot back up the tunnel, leaving the injured boy alone in the dark.
