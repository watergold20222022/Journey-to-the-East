In the wake of the battle against the Silicon Legion, Zhu Bajie had become an overnight icon. His image, or at least the idealized version of his pig-man form, was projected on the neon billboards of the Beast-Man Metropolis. He was given a luxury penthouse in the upper districts, offered seats on corporate boards, and invited to every high-society gala.

But the "Hero of the Central Plaza" was rarely seen. While the city celebrated, Bajie spent his nights in the quiet, sterile luxury of his balcony, staring not at the city lights, but at the stars.

"You're going to get a neck cramp," Alice's voice came from behind him. She walked onto the balcony, her fox-ears twitching. She was dressed in a tailored uniform, a far cry from the rags she wore in the Underground Market. "The Minister of Culture wants to know if you'll attend the unveiling of the statue. They made your tusks a bit more... elegant."

Bajie snorted, not turning around. "They can keep the statue. I don't belong on a pedestal, Alice. I belong on the road."

Alice sighed and leaned against the railing. "I know. You've been staring at that old book every night. You're thinking about them, aren't you?"

Bajie finally looked at her. He pulled the leather-bound diary of Tang Seng from his tunic. "My Master. And my brothers. Sun Wukong, the Great Sage. Sha Seng, the Curtain-Lifting General. We were a fellowship, Alice. A family. If I am here, they are out there somewhere. And if they are half as lost as I was, they need someone to find them."

He looked back at the stars. "I saved this world, but I haven't fulfilled my vows. My journey isn't to be a hero on Kara. It's to follow the Master."

Alice nodded slowly. "I thought you might say that. And honestly? I'm getting bored with being a lieutenant. The paperwork is worse than being chased by the police."

She stepped closer, her expression turning professional. "If you want to find them, you can't just fly a shuttle into the void. Space is too big, even for a 'Pig-King'. You need science. You need to trace the resonance of those 'soul-codes' you mentioned."

"Science?" Bajie raised an eyebrow.

"The AI fleet," Alice said, pointing up toward the captured ships orbiting the planet. "We have their sensor arrays now. They were designed to scan for specific genetic markers across entire solar systems. If we can recalibrate them to look for the spiritual frequency of your companions—the same frequency you felt in that book—we might be able to get a lock."

Bajie's eyes lit up. "Can it be done?"

"Not by me," Alice admitted. "But with the resources of the Defense Headquarters? Yes. We need a special research group. High-level access. Quantum physicists, geneticist, and maybe a few priests who understand the old myths."

The meeting with General Rakafa happened an hour later. The Minotaur was in his office, looking over casualty reports from the reconstruction efforts. When Bajie explained his mission, the room went silent.

"You want to leave?" Rakafa asked, his voice a low rumble. "Now, when the people need a symbol of hope?"

"The people have you, General," Bajie said firmly. "I am a monk's disciple. My hope is tied to him. And if I find him, I might find the reason why all of this happened. Why the humans left. Why your ancestors were created. The answers aren't on Kara. They're out there."

Rakafa stood up and walked to the window. He looked at the city he had spent his life defending. Then he turned back to Bajie.

"A special research group," Rakafa mused. "Project: Fellowship."

"I want to lead it," Alice put in. "Or at least handle the technical coordination."

"Granted," Rakafa said, to their surprise. He walked to his terminal and began tapping in commands. "I'm giving you full priority. Level Zero clearance. You want the captured AI cores? Take them. You want the observatories in the North Pole? Done. You want the deep-space transmitters? They're yours."

He looked at Bajie with a respect that went beyond military rank. "I told you that you reminded me of an old legend. My people have stories too, Captain. Stories of a bull who guarded the gates of heaven. They say he was stubborn, but he never abandoned his brothers. I see that same stubbornness in you."

Rakafa leaned in. "Besides, if there are beings out there like you—this Sun Wukong or this Master—I want them as allies, not enemies. Bringing them here would be the best defense this planet could ever have."

"Thank you, General," Bajie said, bowing slightly.

"Don't thank me yet," Rakafa warned. "Finding a ghost in a galaxy of stars is no easy task. My scientists will work around the clock, but you must be patient."

"I've waited five hundred years under a mountain," Bajie said with a grin. "I can wait a few more weeks."

As they left, the wheels of the Beast-Man bureaucracy began to turn at unprecedented speeds. Within forty-eight hours, the "Special Research Group for Trans-Dimensional Resonance" was established. Labs were cleared, supercomputers were redirected, and the brightest minds of Planet Kara began a task that seemed impossible: tracking the soul of a god.

Bajie sat in the middle of the main lab, surrounded by holograms and buzzing scientists. He held the Master's diary in his lap, closing his eyes.

"We're coming for you, Master," he whispered.

And in the cold vacuum of space, far beyond the reach of Kara's sun, something began to stir in response to the call.
