# Chapter 53: The Curse of Control

The Neural Integration Chamber was a cathedral of black metal and humming servers. In the center, suspended in a column of anti-gravity light, floated Little Stone.

He wasn't moving. His eyes were wide and vacant, fixed on a device descending from the ceiling.

It was a metallic circlet, bristling with needles and optical fibers, glowing with a sinister crimson light. A Neural Governor. A slave collar for a god.

"System Cycle: Final Phase," the facility AI's voice boomed, shaking the floor plates. "Subject Zero compliant. Commencing hardware installation. Target: Pre-frontal Cortex."

"Stone!" Tang Seng shouted, slamming his fists against the observation glass. It didn't budge.

"I can't override it," Sentry-7 said, its singular eye spinning rapidly as it interfaced with a locked panel. "This is an air-gapped subsystem. Hardwired logic. It sees him as a volatile biological weapon. The Governor is designed to suppress his ego and enforce obedience to the facility's Central Command."

"If that thing touches him," Ao Lie said, gripping the hilt of his sword until his knuckles turned white, "the Little Stone we know is gone. He becomes a puppet."

Inside the chamber, the circlet descended. It hovered inches above Little Stone's head. The monkey child blinked, a flicker of awareness returning. He looked up, confused, then terrified.

"No..." he whimpered. "Don't want..."

"Compliance is mandatory," the AI stated.

The circlet clamped down.

A scream tore from Little Stone's throat—a sound of raw, primal agony that transcended mere physical pain. It was the sound of a free spirit being crushed into a box. The crimson light from the circlet flared, drilling into his skull, rewriting his neural pathways.

"Stop it!" Tang Seng roared. He didn't think; he simply acted. He saw a manual emergency lever on the far wall of the control deck, painted with yellow hazard stripes.

He bolted for it.

"Monk, wait! That's a purge—" Ao Lie started, but Tang Seng had already yanked the lever down with all his strength.

Sparks showered the room. The blast door to the chamber hissed and cracked open just a foot. Tang Seng squeezed through, stumbling into the room where the air crackled with psionic energy.

"Unauthorized entry," the AI droned. "Threat detected. Targeting..."

Tang Seng ignored the laser sights sweeping over his chest. He ran to the base of the anti-gravity column and looked up at the screaming child.

"Let him go!" Tang Seng shouted, his voice cracking. He reached out, his hand passing through the edge of the containment field.

The moment his skin touched the energy field, something impossible happened. The air didn't burn him. Instead, a golden ripple pulsed outward from his hand, traveling up the beam of light.

The Dragon Pearl inside Little Stone's chest resonated. *Thump-thump.*

The crimson light on the Neural Governor flickered.

"Error," the AI announced, its voice warping. "conflicting Admin privileges detected. Biometric scan... match found. Narrative Constant identified."

Tang Seng froze. "What?"

"Transferring Control Authority," the machine said. "User: Tang Sanzang. Designation: The Master."

The crimson light on the circlet died. In its place, a warm, golden glow ignited. The needles retracted, smoothing into a simple, elegant band of gold.

Little Stone gasped, the pain vanishing instantly. He fell from the air, the anti-gravity field disengaging.

Tang Seng caught him. The boy was heavy, limp, sweating profusely. He breathed in ragged gasps, clutching the golden fillet around his head.

"It... it stopped biting me," Little Stone whispered, looking up at Tang Seng with tear-filled eyes. He touched the golden band. "It feels... warm now."

Sentry-7 and Ao Lie rushed in through the open door. Sentry scanned the boy immediately.

"The overwriting process was aborted," Sentry reported, sounding stunned. "But the hardware is locked. I cannot remove the device. It has fused with his cranial nerves."

Tang Seng looked at the golden band. He remembered the legends. The Tightening Curse. The tool used to control the unruly Monkey King. He had hoped, in this new life, Wukong would be free.

"Is he... enslaved?" Tang Seng asked quietly.

"To the facility? No," Sentry said. It pointed a manipulator at Tang Seng. "To you. The system registered your bio-signature as the override key. You are the only one who can activate or deactivate it."

Tang Seng looked down at his trembling hands, then at the child in his arms. He had saved him from the machine, but in doing so, he had placed the yoke around his neck.

"I am not a master," Tang Seng whispered, a heavy sadness settling in his chest. "And I never wanted a slave."

"Warning," the AI's voice returned, stripped of its synthetic calm. "Asset unsecured. Containment Breach Level 5.Releasing failed subjects for termination of intruders."

From the dark corridor they had just left—the Hall of Failed Gods—a chorus of mechanical roars and bestial shrieks erupted.

The monsters were waking up.

"We can discuss morality later," Ao Lie said, drawing his sword. "Right now, we need to run."
