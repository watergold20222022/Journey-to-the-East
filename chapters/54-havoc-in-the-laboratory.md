# Chapter 54: Havoc in the Laboratory

The corridor erupted into chaos.

From the shadows of the Storage Wing, the "Failed Gods" emerged. Leading the pack was the creature Ao Lie had identified as "Six Ears." Its mechanical heart thumped loudly in its exposed chest, and its six ears twitched as it triangulated the intruders' positions.

Behind it, the hydraulic gibbon smashed a glass tank, roaring with the sound of grinding metal.

"Defensive formation!" Sentry-7 commanded, its arm transforming into a plasma cannon. It fired a volley of blue bolts, but the gibbon moved with terrifying speed, deflecting the shots with its armored forearms.

Ao Lie stepped forward, his sword humming as he infused it with dragon mana. "I will hold them. Take the Master and the boy!"

The Dragon Prince lunged, engaging the Six-Eared cyborg in a flurry of sparks and steel. But for every strike Ao Lie landed, the cyborg countered with three. It anticipated his moves perfectly.

"It knows the combat style," Ao Lie gritted out, staggering back from a heavy blow. "It has the data of the original!"

Tang Seng pulled Little Stone behind a heavy server rack. The boy was still clutching his head, trembling. The golden band hummed softly.

"I... I'm scared," Little Stone whispered.

"It's okay to be scared," Tang Seng said, though his own heart was pounding. "But we must move."

A crash echoed above them. A mechanical baboon had crawled along the ceiling pipes and dropped down, landing directly between them and the exit. It raised a claw sparking with electricity.

Tang Seng shielded the boy with his body. Sentry-7 was pinned down by the gibbon. Ao Lie was losing ground against Six Ears.

They were trapped.

"Subject Zero," the AI's voice announced over the intercom. "Join your brethren. Embrace the failure."

The baboon lunged.

*CLANG!*

The claw stopped inches from Tang Seng's face. It had been blocked by a black iron rod.

Little Stone stood there, his fear gone. His eyes, previously wide and innocent, were now burning with a cold, golden fire. He held the heavy rod—a piece of debris he had snatched from the floor—with one hand.

"Don't touch him," Little Stone said. His voice sounded different. Deeper. Resonant.

With a flick of his wrist, he sent the mechanical baboon flying across the room. It smashed into a wall and crumpled into scrap.

"Wukong?" Tang Seng whispered.

Little Stone didn't answer. He looked at the iron rod in his hand, then at the chaos around him. He spun the rod. It was a clumsy, heavy thing, but in his hands, it became a blur of motion.

He leaped.

He didn't just jump; he launched himself like a missile. He landed on the gibbon's back, smashed the rod into its hydraulic spine, and backflipped off before the machine hit the ground.

"Whoa," Ao Lie said, momentarily distracted.

The Six-Eared cyborg roared and abandoned Ao Lie, charging at the small monkey. It recognized a challenger.

"Careful, Stone!" Ao Lie warned. "It reads your moves!"

Little Stone stood still. He waited until the cyborg was a breath away, its claws reaching for his throat.

Then he grinned. It was a wild, arrogant grin.

He vanished.

He reappeared behind the cyborg, the rod sweeping low. He swept the cyborg's legs, and as it fell, he slammed the rod down onto its mechanical heart.

*CRUNCH.*

The cyborg twitched and went still.

Little Stone stood amidst the wreckage of the "gods" that science had failed to build. He was panting, the gold fire fading from his eyes, returning to the confused look of a child.

"I..." He looked at his hands. "I just wanted them to stop."

"Warning," the AI blared. "Catastrophic Asset Failure. Self-Destruct Sequence Initiated. T-minus 60 seconds."

"We need an exit! Now!" Sentry-7 shouted.

Little Stone looked at the ceiling. "Up."

"What?"

"The sky is that way." Little Stone pointed his rod at the reinforced ceiling. "I can feel the wind."

He crouched, gathered his strength, and sprang upward. The rod extended—no, it *grew*—guided by the nanites Sentry had installed in his suit earlier? Or perhaps just his will?

He struck a weak point in the ventilation shaft. The metal buckled. Sunlight—real, natural sunlight—filtered down through the dust.

"Go!" Little Stone yelled, motioning for them to follow.

Ao Lie grabbed Tang Seng, leaping up the improvised exit. Sentry-7 followed, calculating the blast radius. Little Stone took one last look at the dark laboratory, at the broken bodies of his "brothers," and leaped after them.

Behind them, the facility exploded, collapsing the canyon floor and burying the secrets of Project WUKONG forever.

They landed on a ridge overlooking the Stone Valley. The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of purple and orange.

Little Stone sat on the edge of the cliff, the golden band glinting on his forehead. He looked at the horizon, silent.

Tang Seng sat beside him. "You saved us."

"They tried to make me a monster," Little Stone said softly. "Am I?"

Tang Seng placed a hand on the boy's shoulder. "No. Monsters destroy for no reason. You fought to protect. That makes you a hero."

Little Stone looked at Tang Seng, then at the golden band. He touched it tentatively.

"Teacher," he said, using the word for the first time. "Where do we go now?"

Tang Seng looked East. "We keep going. Towards the sunrise."
