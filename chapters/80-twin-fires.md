# Chapter 80: Twin Fires

The King of Inspiration sensed them before he saw them. Two massive thermal spikes, approaching from opposite vectors.

"Coming back to watch the show?" He announced, his voice amplified across the factory. "The second batch is about to begin processing."

"Hey, Fish-breath!" Nezha’s voice boomed from the east.

Nezha crashed through the great glass window, bathed in golden light. He was blinding to look at.

"Divine Art: Thousand-Handed Bodhisattva!"

Nezha didn't just have six arms now. His combat frame projected hundreds of hard-light limbs, forming a massive fan behind him. Every hand held a golden weapon.

"Suppression Fire!"

Nezha unleashed hell. A rain of golden beams slammed into the King. The Innocence Shield flared, screaming as it absorbed the kinetic energy.

"Fool!" The King laughed, hiding behind the shimmering barrier. "You are just feeding me! The harder you hit, the more they suffer!"

"I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am!" Nezha shouted, increasing the intensity.

The factory shook. The King was pinned down, focused entirely on maintaining the shield against the onslaught of divine power. His sensors were locked on Nezha, predicting the trajectory of a thousand attacks.

He didn't look down.

From the shadows of the floor, a pool of black liquid moved. It wasn't oil. It was Red Boy.

He slid under the vats, silent as a ghost. He reached the main conduit—the pulsating artery of glass and steel that connected the hostages to the King's throne.

Red Boy emerged from the shadow, his hand wreathed in the silent, black flame of the Void.

*Samadhi Void: Devour.*

He grabbed the conduit.

There was no explosion. No sound. The conduit simply... ceased to carry energy. The Void fire ate the flow. It ate the magic. It ate the connection.

"What?" The King’s display flashed red. *Warning: Power Source Disconnected.*

The Innocence Shield flickered and died.

Nezha saw the opening. "Now!"

He recalled all his hard-light arms into a single, massive construct. He hurled the Universe Ring with everything he had.

**CRACK.**

The ring hit the King of Inspiration in the chest. Calculations indicated the impact force was equal to a meteor strike. The King’s chest furnace shattered. The steam engine exploded. He was thrown backward, crashing into his own throne.

"My... my machine..." The King gurgled, black oil pouring from his shattered chassis. He tried to crawl toward the control panel. "Backup... generator..."

"Denied," Red Boy stepped in front of him.

The boy was glowing with the energy he had siphoned from the conduit. His eyes were white-hot.

"You like to use children as fuel?" Red Boy asked.

He pointed his spear at the King.

"Burn."

A torrent of True Samadhi Fire—purified, hot enough to melt reality—engulfed the King. The metal melted. The flesh vaporized. The King of Inspiration didn't even have time to scream before he was reduced to a pile of slag and ash.

Silence fell over the factory.

Nezha landed next to Red Boy. He looked at the burning remains.

"Overkill," Nezha commented.

"Standard procedure," Red Boy replied, extinguishing his spear.

They turned to the vats. With the machine destroyed, the glass pods unlocked. Thousands of children spilled out onto the floor, coughing, waking up from their nightmare.

Nezha and Red Boy watched them.

"So," Nezha said, crossing his arms. "We have a planet full of refugees. No government. No food. And winter is coming."

"Not my problem," Red Boy turned to leave.

"You can't just leave," Nezha grabbed his shoulder. "You're a prince. Act like one."

Red Boy hesitated. He looked at a small beast-man girl who was staring at him with wide, frightened eyes.

"We stay," Red Boy muttered. "One month. To... stabilize the region."

"One month," Nezha agreed. "Then we fight."

"Then we fight," Red Boy nodded.

They stood together on the platform, overlooking the sea of confused faces—two gods of war who had accidentally become guardians.
