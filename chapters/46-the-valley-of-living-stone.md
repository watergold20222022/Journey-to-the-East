# Chapter 46: The Valley of Living Stone

The lush, vibrant jungle did not fade gradually; it ended abruptly, as if cut by a knife. One step was on soft, mossy earth; the next was on cold, gray shale.

They had arrived at the Stone Valley.

It was a desolate scar on the face of the planet. There were no trees here, no flowers, no singing insects. There was only rock. Jagged spires pierced the mist, looking like the teeth of some subterranean beast. The ground was scattered with boulders of every shape and size, arranged in chaotic patterns that made the eyes ache.

"The atmospheric composition has changed," Sentry-7 reported, its ceramic feet crunching on the gravel. "Oxygen levels dropped by 15%. High concentrations of sulfur and ozone."

Tang Seng pulled his nano-Kasaya tighter around his shoulders. The air was cold, biting with a unnatural chill. "Do you sense him, Ao Lie?"

The Dragon Prince stood with his eyes closed, his silver sword drawn. "I sense... something. It is familiar, but distorted. Like seeing a reflection in a cracked mirror."

They moved deeper into the valley. As they walked, a low, grinding sound began to echo around them. *Skrrrt. Thump. Skrrrt.*

"Watch out!" Ao Lie shouted, pushing Tang Seng aside.

A boulder the size of a water buffalo rolled past them, missing the monk by inches. But there was no slope. The ground was flat. A moment later, the boulder stopped, rotated on its axis, and settled into a new position, as if getting comfortable.

"Living stones," Tang Seng breathed, watching a smaller rock scuttle behind a larger one like a shy child.

"Silicon-based motility," Sentry-7 analyzed, its blue eye tracking the movement of the rocks. "These behave less like geological formations and more like a hive mind of lithoid organisms. They are observing us."

The valley was alive, but in a way that felt ancient and alien. The stones shifted to watch them pass. Some vibrated with a low hum. Others stacked themselves into precarious towers that collapsed and reformed as the group walked by.

Tang Seng ignored the marvels. His heart was pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. The energy—the "echo" the Mother Tree had spoken of—was getting louder. It wasn't the warm, golden light of Wukong; it was a rhythmic throbbing, heavy with pain and rage.

"Here," Tang Seng whispered. "He is here."

They navigated a maze of shifting stone pillars until they reached the center of the valley. There, the ground dipped into a massive crater. And in the wall of the crater, there was a cave.

It wasn't a natural formation. The entrance was a perfect circle, scorched black at the edges as if burned by intense heat. Smoke—or perhaps steam—drifted lazily from the darkness within. The moving stones of the valley seemed to give this place a wide berth, forming a respectful (or fearful) circle around the crater's rim.

"Wukong!" Tang Seng shouted, his voice cracking. He started to run down the slope, his staff forgotten in his haste. "Wukong, I am here!"

A hand of steel and a hand of dragon-scale caught him at the same time.

"Master, stop!" Ao Lie cried, digging his boots into the scree to hold the monk back.

"Release me!" Tang Seng struggled, his eyes fixed on the dark maw of the cave. "He is in there! Can't you feel it? He is calling for me!"

Sentry-7 planted its heavy feet, acting as an anchor. "Guest, my sensors detect dangerous radiation levels emanating from that aperture. Thermal spikes are fluctuating wildly. It is not safe."

"I don't care about safety!" Tang Seng yelled, turning on his protectors with a ferocity they had rarely seen. "My disciple is suffering! He is in pain! Do you expect me to stand here and wait while he screams?"

"We expect you to live," Ao Lie said firmly, his face grim. "If you run in there blindly and die, who will save him then? Who will lead us?"

The Dragon Prince pointed his sword at the cave entrance. A sudden burst of red lightning arcled across the opening, sizzling against the rocks.

"Look," Ao Lie said softly. "That is not just fire. That is chaotic qi. It destroys everything it touches. If you step through that without preparation, your mortal body—even with the nanosuit—will be vaporized."

Tang Seng stared at the red lightning. It crackled with a sound like tearing silk. It was terrifying. And yet, beneath the danger, he felt the undeniable pull of the Monkey King's soul.

He stopped struggling, slumping against Sentry's ceramic arm. The adrenaline faded, leaving him trembling.

"You are right," Tang Seng whispered, his voice trembling. "I... I lost my mind for a moment."

"It is the valley," Sentry-7 suggested calmly. "The psycho-acoustic resonance of the stones amplifies anxiety. We must proceed with tactical caution."

Tang Seng nodded, straightening his robes. He looked at the cave, at the smoke and the lightning.

"Okay," he said, gripping his staff again until his knuckles turned white. "We prepare. But we do not leave. Whatever is in that cave... we face it together."

The wind howled through the stone forest, carrying with it a sound from the cave—a low, guttural growl that sounded like a beast dreaming of war. Tang Seng stood his ground, waiting for the lightning to clear, ready to step into the dark.
