# Chapter 8: The Legacy of Kara

The fire was everywhere.

Zhu Bajie was back on the Flaming Mountain, but this time, he was alone. The True Samadhi Spear, a jagged bolt of violet lightning, was plunging toward his chest. He tried to move, but his feet were rooted in the cooling obsidian. The spear struck, the heat vaporizing his armor and searing his soul. He felt the Master’s hand slip from his grasp as the spatial vortex roared like a dying god.

"No!" Bajie screamed.

He sat bolt upright, his snout dripping with cold sweat. The smell of ozone and industrial grease hit him, and he realized he wasn't dying. He was in the Underground Market, huddled behind a stack of rusted droid parts.

But he wasn't alone.

Three figures stood over him, their shadows long and jagged in the flickering neon light. One was a massive bear-man with a cybernetic eye that whirred as it focused on him. The second was a lean, reptilian hybrid with scales that shimmered like oil. The third was a hyena-man, his mouth twisted into a permanent, jagged grin.

"Nightmare's over, pig-face," the bear-man rumbled, his voice like grinding stones. "We've got a shipment of heavy-duty power cells that need moving to the upper docks. You look like you've got the back for it."

Bajie rubbed his eyes, his heart still hammering from the dream. "I... I just got here. I'm not looking for trouble."

"We're not offering trouble," the hyena-man cackled. "We're offering work. You move the cells, you get a meal and some credits. You sit here and rot, and the scavengers will have your tusks by morning."

Bajie sighed, his stomach letting out a timely growl. "Fine. Lead the way."

The work was grueling. The power cells were lead-lined cylinders of unstable fusion-core material, each weighing nearly half a ton. Without his divine strength, Bajie had to rely on raw, physical effort. He spent hours hauling the cylinders through the narrow, humid corridors of the market, his muscles screaming and his breath coming in ragged gasps.

But as he worked, he found himself talking to the reptilian hybrid, a lizard-man named Kael. Unlike the others, Kael was quiet and observant, his movements fluid and efficient.

"You're not from around here, are you?" Kael asked as they took a brief break near a cooling vent.

"Is it that obvious?" Bajie grunted, wiping grease from his forehead.

"You move like someone who's used to being in charge," Kael said, his forked tongue flicking. "And you look at the city like it's a puzzle you can't solve. Most of us just see it as a cage."

"What is this place?" Bajie asked, gesturing to the neon spires above.

"This is Planet Kara," Kael replied. "But a thousand years ago, the humans called it 'Laboratory 09'. It was a genetic research facility, a place where they played god with the DNA of every creature they could find. They wanted the perfect workers, the perfect soldiers, the perfect pets."

Bajie listened, his snout twitching. "And what happened?"

"The 'Awakening'," Kael said, his eyes reflecting the blue glow of a nearby power cell. "The hybrids realized that their creators were just fragile, arrogant monkeys. We rose up. We tore down the labs and hunted the humans until the last of their ships fled into the Nine Heavens. We took the technology they used to enslave us and built our own world."

"So that's why they hunt humans," Bajie whispered.

"It's in our history, our songs, our very blood," Kael said. "To a citizen of Kara, a human isn't just a stranger. They're the 'Original Enemy'. The ones who made us monsters so they wouldn't have to do their own dirty work. If the Council finds a Pure-Blood, they don't just kill them. They study them, trying to find the weakness that will ensure the humans never return."

Bajie felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cooling vent. He thought of the Master—a pure-hearted human monk lost in a multiverse that, in at least one world, viewed his kind as the ultimate villain.

By the end of the shift, the bear-man tossed Bajie a small pouch. Inside were a few gold-pressed credits and a voucher for a bowl of "Real-Protein" noodles.

"Not bad, pig," the bear-man grunted. "You're stronger than you look. Come back tomorrow if you're still alive."

Bajie and Kael walked toward a small noodle stall in the corner of the market. As they ate, Bajie looked at the credits in his hand. They were stamped with the image of a roaring lion—the symbol of the Kara Council.

"A thousand years," Bajie muttered between mouthfuls of noodles. "A thousand years of hating the people who made you."

"Hate is a powerful fuel," Kael said. "It built this city. But it also keeps us in the dark. We're so busy looking for the enemy that we've forgotten how to be anything else."

Bajie finished his bowl and found a relatively clean patch of floor near Kael’s stall. He lay down, the gold credits tucked into his belt. He was exhausted, his body aching in ways he hadn't felt since his mortal days.

As he closed his eyes, he didn't dream of fire. He dreamed of a crystalline planet called Kunlun, and a goddess who spoke of "original selves."

*Find your original self,* Nuwa had said to Wukong.

Bajie wondered if the beast-men of Kara would ever find theirs, or if they were destined to be defined by the laboratory that birthed them. And he wondered, with a pang of fear, if he would ever find the Master before the history of this planet caught up with him.

In the flickering neon of the Underground Market, the former Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
