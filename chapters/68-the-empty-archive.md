# Chapter 68: The Empty Archive

Planet Kunlun was usually a spectacle of light—a Dyson Sphere constructed of crystal data-shards, glowing with the accumulated knowledge of the multiverse.

When Red Boy arrived, he didn't marvel at the architecture. He scanned it for targets.

"Scan complete," his ship's AI reported. "Life signs: Nominal. Threat level: Zero. Target 'Sun Wukong': Not found."

Red Boy slammed his fist onto the console. "He was here. The Bull said he was here."

He docked his ship at the Central Spire and marched into the Grand Archive. The halls were silent, save for the hum of cooling fans.

"Visitor," a soft, disembodied voice greeted him. A hologram of an old woman appeared. "I am Tianji. The Keeper of Records. You bring a heavy shadow with you, child."

"Where is he?" Red Boy demanded, towering over the hologram. "The Monkey. Sun Wukong. Where did he go?"

"The Pilgrim came," Tianji said calmly. "He sought answers about his past. He found them. And he left."

"Left? To where?"

Tianji gestured to a star map that materialized in the air. "He seeks the East. He seeks the source of the Signal that called him. He travels now through the Veridian Sector."

"Veridian..." Red Boy narrowed his eyes. "That's a backwater. A graveyard."

"He is not alone," Tianji added. "He travels with the Dragon Prince. The Monk. And... himself."

"What does that mean?"

"The timeline is fractured," Tianji explained. "There are echoes. The Wukong you hate... he is changing. He is becoming something new. Something perhaps... innocent."

"Innocent?!" Red Boy laughed, and the sound shattered a nearby data-crystal. "You lie! He is a monster! A trickster!"

"You see only what your pain allows you to see," Tianji said sadly. "Just as you do not see the leash around your own neck."

Red Boy stiffened. "I have no master."

"Do you?" Tianji waved her hand. A stream of data appeared—encrypted files that Red Boy's suit sensors picked up. "The energy you wield... 'Shadow Flame'... it has a signature. It matches an entity in our forbidden archives. Designation: The Devourer. The Prince of Night."

"You know him?"

"He is an old enemy of the Order," Tianji said. "He does not grant power, child. He farms it. He plants seeds of hatred in broken souls, waits for them to ripen, and then he harvests them. You are not a king. You are a crop."

Red Boy wanted to scream. He wanted to burn this old woman and her library to ash. But a cold knot of doubt formed in his stomach. The Bull had said the same thing. *Interest.*

"I don't care," Red Boy whispered, pushing the doubt down into the dark. "Even if I am a crop... I will be the one that chokes the gardener. But first... I kill the Monkey."

He turned away from Tianji.

"Give me the coordinates," he ordered. "Or I burn this library."

Tianji sighed. She knew the probability of this outcome was 100%.

"Sector 9. The Veridia System. He has just departed for the Deep East."

"Good."

Red Boy walked back to his ship. He had a destination. He had a target. And if he was being used... well, he would just have to make sure he was the sharpest tool in the box.

As his ship blasted out of the Spire, Tianji watched him go on her monitors.

"Poor child," she whispered. "He runs so fast, but he carries his prison with him."
