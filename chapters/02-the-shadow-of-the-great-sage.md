# Chapter 2: The Shadow of the Great Sage

The Eternal Hell was not a place of fire and brimstone. It was worse. It was a void of absolute sensory deprivation, a pocket dimension where the background radiation of the universe went to die. There was no floor, no ceiling, only a crushing, silent nothingness that felt like cold lead against the skin.

Red Boy sat huddled in a corner of reality that didn't exist. His high-tech flight suit, once a vibrant crimson that rivaled a supernova, was now a dull, scarred grey. The HUD inside his helmet flickered with "CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE" warnings, the red text the only light in his universe.

He didn't care about the suit. He didn't care about the cold. His mind was a furnace, fueled by a single, burning emotion: hatred.

It wasn't just hatred for Guanyin, the Architect who had cast him here. It was a deeper, older poison. It was the shadow that had loomed over his entire life. The shadow of the Monkey.

Closing his eyes, Red Boy let the darkness of the void pull him back. Back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. Back to the day his world had changed.

***

In his memory, the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit wasn't just a mountain; it was a vertical city of glass and gold, a fortress-monastery protected by a shimmering planetary shield. It was the hub of the rebel alliance, the place where the "Great Sage" had dared to defy the Hegemony of the Jade Palace.

Red Boy had been small then—barely more than a child, his potential for the Samadhi fire just a flicker in his veins. He had stood on a high observation deck, clutching the railing as the sky above turned into a graveyard of falling stars.

The Heavenly Court had sent everything.

"Look at them, boy," a voice had rumbled behind him.

Red Boy turned to see his father, the Bull Demon King. He looked magnificent in his heavy hydraulic power armor, his massive axe humming with low-frequency vibrations. But even then, the young Red Boy had seen the sweat on his father's brow, the way his hands trembled as he checked his weapon's charge.

"The Monkey is a fool," the Bull Demon King had muttered, more to himself than to his son. "He brings the wrath of the heavens upon us all. We should have stayed in the outer rims."

Red Boy looked back at the sky. A streak of gold was cutting through the formation of celestial dreadnoughts. It was Sun Wukong. He wasn't just fighting; he was dancing. His Ruyi Jingu Bang, a staff of shifting nanomachines, expanded to the size of a skyscraper one moment, crushing a cruiser, then shrunk to a needle the next, piercing the bridge of a command ship.

Then, the heavy hitters arrived.

The clouds parted to reveal a figure wreathed in blue lightning. Erlang Shen, the Hegemony’s greatest executioner. His third eye—a high-precision targeting laser—glowed with a terrifying violet light. Beside him hovered Nezha, the Third Prince, his cybernetic combat rig deploying six mechanical arms, each wielding a different energy weapon. His Wind and Fire Wheels were localized gravity-defying thrusters that left trails of burning ozone in the air.

"They've sent the enforcers," the Bull Demon King whispered, his voice cracking. "We're lost."

Red Boy watched, his heart hammering against his ribs. He expected his father to leap into the fray, to show the strength that the legends spoke of. Instead, the Bull Demon King waited. He waited until Wukong was already engaged, until the Monkey was surrounded by a swarm of celestial drones.

Only then did the Bull Demon King charge.

It was a pathetic display. He swung his axe with brute force, lacking the precision of the warriors above. He was slow, his movements telegraphed. When Nezha turned one of his energy spears toward him, the Bull Demon King flinched, his shield generator overloading instantly. He was forced to retreat, his armor smoking, leaving Wukong to face the two greatest warriors of the heavens alone.

Red Boy felt a cold knot of shame in his stomach. His father, the Great King of the West, was a coward. A weakling who hid behind the shadow of a greater man.

But Wukong... Wukong was something else.

The battle between the three was a symphony of destruction. Erlang Shen’s laser eye carved canyons into the mountain, but Wukong moved faster than the light itself, his golden armor reflecting the beams. Nezha unleashed a barrage of fire-rings, but Wukong spun his staff so fast it created a vacuum shield, extinguishing the flames before they could touch him.

"Is that all you've got, you palace lapdogs?" Wukong’s voice had echoed across the entire planet, broadcast on every frequency.

He took them both on. He parried Erlang’s energy blade with one hand and kicked Nezha’s gravity-wheels with the other. He was a blur of golden light, a glitch in the system that the heavens couldn't fix. Even when Erlang Shen deployed his transformation protocols, turning into a giant of pure energy, Wukong simply laughed and grew to match him, his staff becoming a pillar that held up the sky.

He didn't lose. Even when the battle ended in a stalemate and the mountain was besieged, Wukong stood tall, unbowed and unbroken.

Red Boy had watched it all. He had seen the power, the arrogance, and the sheer, terrifying beauty of it. And he had looked at his father, who was busy repairing a dent in his leg-plate, complaining about the cost of the repairs.

In that moment, the seed of jealousy had taken root.

*Why him?* Red Boy had thought. *Why does the Monkey get the glory? Why is he the one the stars fear?*

He didn't want to be like his father. He didn't want to be a footnote in someone else's legend. He wanted to be the one who broke the Monkey. He wanted to prove that the Samadhi fire, his fire, was hotter than the sun that forged Wukong’s armor.

***

Back in the Eternal Hell, Red Boy opened his eyes. The "CRITICAL" warning was still blinking.

"I saw your weakness, Wukong," he whispered into the void. "I saw you bleed on the Flaming Mountain. Guanyin saved you, but she won't be there next time."

He reached out a hand. A tiny, microscopic spark of violet light appeared at his fingertip. It was small, but in the absolute darkness of the void, it was everything.

The Samadhi fire didn't need oxygen. It didn't need fuel. It fed on rage. And in the Eternal Hell, Red Boy had an infinite supply.

"I will surpass you," he vowed, the violet spark growing into a steady flame. "I will burn the shadow of the Great Sage until there is nothing left but ash."
