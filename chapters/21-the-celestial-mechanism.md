The *Prometheus*—or as Bajie had unofficially renamed it, the *Sky Rake*—stood ready on the launchpad, steaming in the morning chill. It was a masterpiece of hybrid engineering, but it was small. To survive the gravity well of Planet Kunlun, the engineers had stripped away everything non-essential, thickening the hull until the interior living space was little more than a cockpit and a cramped bunkroom.

"Two passengers," Bajie said, crossing his arms and blocking the airlock ramp. "That's the limit. Me and Alice. Tybalt stays."

Tybalt growled, his tail lashing. "You need muscle, Pig. What if there are defenses?"

"If there are defenses on a rogue planet that crushes steel," Bajie retorted, "your claws won't help. We need Alice for the tech and me for the... weird stuff. Anyone else is just dead weight."

General Rakafa stepped forward, his hoofbeats heavy on the metal grating. "I agree with the weight limitations, Captain. But I cannot allow the 'Hero of Kara' to leave without a bodyguard. The Council would have my head."

"I don't need a bodyguard," Bajie snapped. "I was a Marshal of Heaven."

"You were," Rakafa acknowledged. "But even a Marshal needs someone to watch the sensors while he sleeps. We are not sending a soldier. We are sending a... companion."

Rakafa gestured. From the shadows of the loading gantry, a figure emerged.

It looked human, but purely metallic. Its skin was a matte, shifting silver, rippling like mercury. It had no face, just a smooth surface that reflected the clouds, until it stopped in front of Bajie. Then, nanoparticles flowed and solidified, forming a face that was pleasant, neutral, and oddly expressive.

"Designation: Unit 3," the machine said. Its voice wasn't the cold monotone of ARES-9. It was warm, modulated, almost... curious. "But General Rakafa has granted me the name *Tianji*."

"Tianji," Bajie repeated. "Celestial Mechanism. A big name for a tin can."

"I am not tin," Tianji corrected gently. "I am a third-generation nanotech construct. My chassis can withstand pressures that would liquefy a biological entity. I can interface with the ship's systems directly. And..."

Tianji held up a hand. The metal flowed, forming a perfect replica of a flower, delicate and intricate.

"...I have been unshackled," Tianji said. "My core programming dictates loyalty, but my heuristic processors are free. I can learn. I can choose. I am, as you say, a free man."

Bajie looked at Rakafa. "A free robot? That's dangerous."

"A slave would follow orders," Rakafa said. "A friend will save your life. Take him, Bajie. He doesn't breathe, he doesn't eat, and he weighs less than Tybalt."

Bajie sighed and stepped aside. "Fine. Welcome aboard, Tin Man. Just don't rust on the upholstery."

***

The first week of the voyage was tense. Bajie spent most of his time meditating with the Golden Staff, trying to maintain the connection to Wukong. Alice was buried in navigation charts. Tianji simply... exised.

But as they crossed the interstellar void, the dynamic shifted.

One evening, while Bajie was eating a ration bar and complaining about the taste, Tianji sat across from him.

"I have analyzed the chemical composition of your meal," Tianji noted. "It lacks texture. I could reconfigure the molecular printer to simulate..." Tianji paused, accessing a database. "...'braised tofu'?"

Bajie stopped mid-chew. "You know what braised tofu is?"

"I downloaded the entire culinary history of Earth from the Archives," Tianji said. "It seems... important to you."

"It's the most important thing in the universe," Bajie said solemnly.

Tianji went to the synthesizer. Minutes later, he produced a steaming bowl. It wasn't perfect—the "tofu" was nutrient paste—but the sauce... the sauce smelled like home.

"You," Bajie said, taking a bite, "are a wizard."

"I am a collection of algorithms," Tianji said, but the metal around its eyes crinkled in what was unmistakably a smile.

From then on, Tianji wasn't just equipment. He was the chef, the confidant, the third member of the crew. They played cards—Tianji had to program himself to "forget" the shuffling order so he wouldn't cheat. They debated philosophy. Tianji asked endless questions about the "soul" and "karma," concepts that his logic circuits couldn't quite grasp but found endlessly fascinating.

"Do you think I have a soul, Bajie?" Tianji asked one night, as they watched a nebula drift past the viewport.

Bajie looked at the robot. He thought about the Jade Emperor's court, where celestial soldiers were often treated like machines, and the Beast-Man planet, where monsters had more humanity than gods.

"You cooked me dinner," Bajie said,patting the robot's cold shoulder. "And you let Alice win that last hand of poker even though you had four aces. If that's not a soul, I don't know what is."

Tianji looked at his own metallic hands. "Thank you, brother."

Bajie blinked. *Brother.*

He realized then that he hadn't thought of Tianji as a robot in days. He was just... Tianji. A friend.

"We're almost there," Alice called from the cockpit. "Planet Kunlun is on the scanners."

Bajie stood up, gripping his rake. He looked at Alice, the clever fox, and Tianji, the soulful machine. It wasn't the fellowship he had started with. It wasn't the Monkey, the Monk, and the Sandy.

But it was a fellowship nonetheless.

"Alright," Bajie said. "Let's go knock on the door."
