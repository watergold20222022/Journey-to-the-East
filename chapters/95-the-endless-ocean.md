# Chapter 95: The Endless Ocean

The *Sky Rake* dropped out of warp, its hull groaning from the strain.

"We need coolant," Bajie said, tapping a fluctuating gauge. "And a new manifold. And maybe a stiff drink. This ship took a beating back there."

"Course locked," Tianji announced. "Destination: Planet Ao. Also known as the Dragon Star."

Through the viewport, a massive blue sphere filled the darkness. It was a world without land. No continents, no islands. Just a single, heavy ocean that reflected the light of its binary suns like a polished sapphire.

"Looks peaceful," Wukong commented, putting his feet up on the console.

"It shouldn't be," Tianji zoomed in. "Scan data indicates... turbulence."

As they got closer, they saw it. The ocean wasn't calm. It was raging. Waves the size of mountain ranges were rolling across the equator. The atmosphere was a chaotic swirl of hurricane clouds.

"Warning," Tianji's voice sharpened. "Gravitational anomaly detected. The sea level is rising... into orbit."

"Into orbit?" Bajie squinted. "That's impossible."

"Look," Wukong pointed.

A massive pillar of water, miles wide, was lifting off the surface of the planet, defying gravity, reaching up like a liquid finger trying to touch the void.

"Hold on!" Wukong grabbed the controls.

The gravitational shear hit them. The ship shuddered violently. Alarms screamed.

"We're caught in the updraft!" Tianji calculated. "Correcting thrusters."

Suddenly, the water pillar exploded. From within the liquid chaos, a squadron of interceptors burst forth. But they weren't spaceships. They were biomechanical sharks, sleek and silver, ridden by warriors in hydro-suits.

"Unidentified craft," a voice crackled over the comms, distorted by static and the sound of rushing water. "You are entering a restricted disaster zone. Turn back or be liquidated."

Wukong hit the comms button. "Liquidated? Is that a fish joke? I am Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equal to Heaven! I'm here for a pit stop, not a bath!"

There was a pause on the other end.

"Great Sage?" The voice changed tone. "The Monkey King?"

The shark-riders broke formation, flanking the *Sky Rake*.

"Follow us," the leader commanded. "Dive engaging in 3... 2... 1..."

The interceptors dove back into the water pillar.

"They want us to go underwater?" Bajie paled. "In a spaceship?"

"It's hermetically sealed, Pig," Wukong grinned. "Tianji, follow them!"

The *Sky Rake* nosed down and plunged into the towering wall of water.

The transition was jarring. One moment, stars. The next, a world of deep, crushing blue.

They descended rapidly. The turbulence faded as they went deeper, replaced by the eerie calm of the abyss. Bioluminescent creatures floated past the windows—jellyfish the size of cities, whales with neon circuitry running along their spines.

And then, they saw it.

The Crystal Palace.

It wasn't a building. It was a glowing mega-city enclosed in a massive, translucent dome on the ocean floor. Towers of coral and glass spiraled upward, connected by tubes of flowing light. It was breathtakingly beautiful, but Wukong's sharp eyes saw the cracks in the dome, the emergency lights flashing on every street corner.

They docked at a high-pressure airlock. A delegation was waiting for them.

Leading them was a tall figure in armor made of dragon scales and powered exo-skeleton parts. He held a trident that crackled with electricity. But his face... his face was weary. His beard was grey, and his dragon horns looked chipped.

"Old Ao!" Wukong hopped off the ramp, waving his hand.

Dragon King Ao Guang didn't smile. He stepped forward and clasped Wukong's hand with a grip that was desperate.

"Great Sage," Ao Guang's voice was heavy, like grinding stones. "You have no idea how glad I am to see you."

"What's happening, Old Dragon?" Wukong asked, sensing the tension. "Your planet looks like it's trying to shake itself apart."

"It is," Ao Guang turned to look at his trembling city. The ground shook beneath their feet, a low rumble that vibrated through the water.

"We are dying, Wukong," the Dragon King whispered. "The Heart of the Ocean is failing. And if it stops... this entire world will become a tomb."
