The mood in the Engineering Bay had turned stagnant. Days of simulations had only confirmed the initial assessment: conventional drilling was impossible. The heat shielding required to reach the anomaly would weigh more than the city itself.

Zhu Bajie drummed his fingers on the table, the rhythmic tapping echoing his impatience. "So we're back to scratching the dirt with spoons."

Alice, who had been staring at the tactical display of the orbiting fleet, suddenly stood up. Her eyes narrowed. "No. We're thinking too small. We're thinking like miners. We need to think like soldiers."

She tapped the console, bringing up a schematic of the captured Human Fleet. "The flagship, the *Prometheus*, and its escort destroyers. They're equipped with orbital bombardment lasers. Class-A Thermal Lances. Designed to glass continents."

Rakafa frowned. "We deactivated those weapons systems. They are too dangerous."

"Reactivate them," Alice said, tracing a line from the fleet to the planet's surface. "We don't glass a continent. We focus the beam. All one hundred ships, firing in a synchronized, tight-beam convergence pattern. We don't dig. We burn a path."

"You want to shoot the planet?" Tybalt asked, impressed. "That's... aggressive."

"It's precise," Alice corrected. "We vaporize the rock column directly above the signal. We turn the crust into a glass tunnel."

Bajie looked at the hologram. It was crazy. It was dangerous. It could trigger earthquakes.

"Do it," Bajie said.

The evacuation of Sector 7—the target zone—took three days. When the fleet aligned, the sky turned dark as the massive ships blocked out the sun.

"Convergence locked," Alice's voice came over the comms. She was on the *Prometheus*, coordinating the firing sequence. "Target depth: 10,000 meters. Firing in 3... 2... 1..."

The sky split open. A pillar of blinding white light descended from the heavens, striking the barren rock of the Badlands. There was no sound at first, only a shockwave of displaced air that flattened the surrounding hills. Then came the roar, a continuous, thundering boom that shook the teeth of everyone in the observation bunker.

The ground turned to liquid. Rock vaporized instantly. The beam drilled down, a lance of god-fire piercing the skin of the world.

For ten minutes, the bombardment continued. Then, abruptly, it stopped. The silence that followed was heavy with ringing ears.

"Scanning..." a technician reported. " shaft matches projections. Depth... 10,000 meters. The walls have fused into obsidian. It's stable."

"Prepare the drop pod," Bajie ordered.

***

The descent was unlike anything Bajie had experienced. The specialized pod, reinforced with ablated shielding, dropped into the smoking throat of the world. The walls of the shaft were smooth, black glass, still glowing with residual heat.

"Approaching terminus," the pilot announced. "Sensors are picking up... interference."

"What kind of interference?" Bajie asked over the comms.

"Magnetic. Massive amounts of it. It's scrambling the radar."

The pod slowed, its retro-rockets firing. They touched down on a ledge of fused rock. The laser hadn't stopped because of a timer; it had stopped because it hit something it couldn't burn.

Bajie stepped out, his heat-suit humming. The air was superheated, shimmering with distortion.

He walked toward the center of the impact crater. The ground here wasn't rock. It was metal.

Sticking out of the center of the crater, completely unharmed by a laser barrage that could vaporize a mountain, was a pillar of black iron.

No, not iron.

Bajie wiped the visor of his helmet. He stepped closer. The heat was intense, but a different kind of warmth washed over him. A familiar warmth.

The pillar was about the thickness of a rice bowl. On its ends, he could see golden bands.

"Impossible," Bajie breathed.

He reached out. His gauntlet touched the cold metal. The pillar hummed.

Analysis text scrolled across his HUD, but he didn't need it. He knew the inscription running down the side, even if it was covered in a thousand years of geological accretion.

*Ruyi Jingu Bang.* The As-You-Will Golden Hoop Rod.

"Is that..." Alice's voice crackled in his ear. "Is that a weapon?"

"It is *the* weapon," Bajie whispered. "It belongs to my Big Brother. Sun Wukong."

He tried to lift it. The rod didn't budge. It was rooted in the planet, heavy as the galaxy itself.

"Why is it here?" Tybalt asked. "If the Monkey King is lost in space, why is his cudgel buried in the crust of a Beast-Man planet?"

"I don't know," Bajie said, running his hand along the golden band. The metal pulsed, a slow, rhythmic beat that matched the pounding of his own heart. "But this hasn't just been dropped here. It's... anchoring something. Or sealing something."

He looked up at the circle of sky far above, then down at the weapon that had once terrorized the heavens.

"He was here," Bajie said, his voice firm. "Or he sent this here. Either way, we aren't just looking for a diary anymore. We're looking for the Great Sage."

The discovery was a triumph, but the mystery had only deepened. The Golden Staff stood silent, a sentinel in the dark, guarding a secret that lay even deeper than the drill could reach.
