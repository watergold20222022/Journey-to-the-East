# Chapter 75: The Fall of the War God

The *Red Armillary* disintegrated around Nezha as he punched the eject button. He didn't need the ship anymore. He was the weapon.

He plummeted into the golden maelstrom, his Wind Fire Wheels spinning up to relativistic speeds. Below him, the Yellow Wind King—a titan of shifting sand and nano-drones—was being torn apart by the black void-fire of a small, floating child.

"Hey!" Nezha shouted, his voice amplified by the divine acoustics of his armor. He threw the Universe Ring.

The golden hoop expanded to the size of a station, slamming into Red Boy with the weight of a collapsing star. It was a hit that should have cracked a planet.

Red Boy didn't even flinch. He caught the ring with one hand.

The shockwave blew the surrounding storm clouds away for a thousand miles. Red Boy looked at the massive ring, then at Nezha.

"You brought a toy," Red Boy said. His voice was layer upon layer of distorted echoes.

"It’s a containment field, brat!" Nezha slammed into the ring, driving his Fire-tipped Spear at Red Boy’s throat.

At the same time, the Yellow Wind King, sensing an ally, surged forward. **"WIND BINDING!"**

Trillions of nano-drones swarmed Red Boy, locking his limbs in a prison of solid gold. The titan formed a blade of concentrated solar plasma and thrust it at Red Boy’s chest, synchronized with Nezha’s spear.

It was a perfect pincer attack. God and Titan against Demon.

"Cute," Red Boy whispered.

The Samadhi Void flared.

It wasn't an explosion. It was an erasure.

The golden nano-drones simply ceased to exist. The Yellow Wind King’s plasma blade dissolved into entropy. Nezha’s spear, forging from the heart of a dragon, hit an invisible wall of coldness that numbed his arms to the shoulder.

Red Boy reached out and grabbed the Yellow Wind King’s face.

"You are noisy," Red Boy said.

*DELETE.*

The Titan screamed as his code was unraveled. In a microsecond, the ruler of System 81-X, a being that had survived for millennia, crumbled into static and then into nothing. Not even dust remained.

Nezha’s eyes widened. "Impossible."

"You're next," Red Boy turned his gaze to the Prince.

Nezha reacted on instinct. "Three Heads, Six Arms!"

His combat frame overclocked. Hard-light avatars manifested, wielding six divine weapons. The Demon Conquering Pestle, the Yin-Yang Swords, the Gold Brick. Nezha became a whirlwind of destruction, raining thousands of blows per second on the boy.

Red Boy didn't block. He walked through the storm of attacks. The swords shattered on his skin. The pestle bent against his forehead.

He casually reached through the flurry of limbs and grabbed Nezha by the throat. The grip was unbreakable.

"You are weak," Red Boy said, sounding genuinely disappointed. "Detailed scans indicated the Third Prince was a warrior. You are just... a battery."

Darkness flooded Nezha’s veins. He felt his essence being drained, his fusion core sputtering.

"I... am... not... food!" Nezha roared, detonating his external armor plating in a shaped nuclear blast.

The explosion broke Red Boy’s grip, but the recoil sent Nezha rocketing downward.

"Stay down," Red Boy pointed a finger. A beam of concentrated Void struck Nezha in the chest.

It was like being hit by a falling moon. Nezha crashed through the atmosphere of the nearest solid planet—a barren rock seemingly made of iron and sulfur. He hit the surface, but he didn't stop. The kinetic force was so great that he punched through the crust, through the mantle, melting the rock as he passed.

He fell for minutes, crashing through layers of geological history, until he slammed into the planet's liquid iron core.

*CRUNCH.*

Nezha lay embedded in the molten metal. His armor was gone. His bones were pulverized. His systems were offline.

Above, in the high orbit, Red Boy scanned the debris. The Yellow Wind King was gone, and with him, any record of the Monkey's passing. The library logs of the system had been part of the Titan's mind.

"Useless," Red Boy spat. "Dead end."

He turned away from the planet, opening a rift in space. He didn't bother checking if Nezha survived. To him, the Prince was trash.

Silence returned to the core.

Buried in the pressure of a billion tons of iron, Nezha’s broken body floated in the magma.

*System Reboot... Failed.*
*Life Support... Critical.*
*Divine Essence... 2%.*

"He... ignored me," Nezha’s thought drifted in the darkness.

The insult stung more than the broken spine. Red Boy hadn't verified the kill because he didn't care.

"He thinks I'm trash."

Nezha’s hand twitched. The lotus root fibers of his muscular structure began to glow.

"I am Nezha," he whispered into the magma. "I don't die. I just reload."

He opened his mouth and *drank*.

Not air. Heat. Pressure. Radiation. He pulled the geothermal energy of the planet’s core into his body. The molten iron swirled around him, drawn by a magnetic will.

*Protocol: Lotus Rebirth. Maximum Input.*

The planet groaned. The core began to cool rapidly as Nezha sucked the thermal energy dry. His bones snapped back into place, stronger than before. His skin knit together, harder than the iron surrounding him. His fusion reactor reignited, turning from a flicker to a roaring sun.

**Boom.**

A shockwave of red light exploded from the planet's surface, cracking the crust from pole to pole.

Nezha shot out of the fissure, hovering in space. He was naked, his body wreathed in red lightning. The Armillary Sash reformed from the ambient energy, wrapping around him.

He looked at the empty spot where Red Boy had vanished.

He wiped a streak of magma from his cheek and smiled. It was a terrifying, manic smile.

"Wukong was a rival," Nezha laughed, the sound echoing on the radio frequencies. "But this... this is a *monster*."

His eyes burned with a new, fanatical light.

"Finally. Someone who can actually break me."

He summoned his Wind Fire Wheels. They burned blue now, superheated by the core energy.

"Run little boy," Nezha whispered. "The game has just started."
