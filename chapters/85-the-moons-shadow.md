# Chapter 85: The Moon's Shadow

The sensors pinged at dawn.

"Contact," Nezha announced, packing his satchel. "Twelve ships. Galactic Guard livery. Hospital cruisers and escort frigates. They're hailing the planet."

"They're early," Red Boy said, extinguishing the fire in the main forge.

They stood in the center of the factory for the last time. The children were awake, lined up in neat rows. They weren't scared anymore. They were clean, fed, and armed.

Rolo stepped forward, his obsidian gauntlets retracted. "You are leaving?"

"The people coming for you... they follow rules," Nezha explained, checking the straps of his armor. "I don't follow rules very well. And he," he pointed at Red Boy, "breaks them for breakfast."

"If they see us," Red Boy added, "they will try to arrest us. Then we would have to fight them. And that would ruin the rescue."

"Where will you go?" Nova asked, clutching her frost-flame generator.

"Up," Nezha pointed to the sky. "To the moon. We'll be watching."

"If anyone hurts you," Red Boy’s eyes flashed with a dangerous promise. "Look at the moon. If you see a red flare... that means I'm coming back to eat them."

Rolo nodded seriously. "We will hold the line, Teacher."

"Good," Red Boy patted the tiger-boy on the head. "Don't die."

Nezha turned to the Golems. "Protocol: Guardian. Authority transfer to: Rolo and Nova."

"Acknowledged," the massive machines rumbled, bowing their iron heads.

Nezha and Red Boy walked to the back exit, the one leading to the launch pad where *Red Armillary* had been repaired (mostly with duct tape and hope).

They didn't say goodbye. Gods didn't do goodbyes.

Minutes later, a streak of red light shot up from the surface, piercing the smog and vanishing into the black.

The Galactic Guard fleet landed an hour later.

Captain Elara of the rescue ship *Nightingale* expected a horror show. She expected starving wraiths and piles of bodies.

Instead, she was met by a disciplined formation of armed children, flanked by five thousand massive, glowing robots.

"Identify yourselves," Elara asked over the loudspeaker, stunned.

"Attributes of the Lament Vanguard," Rolo shouted back, his voice steady. "We are secure. We request transport to a Class-A Habitat World. And we are bringing our robots."

Elara blinked. "Uh... permission granted."

High above, on the dark side of the barren moon *Crateris*, two figures sat on the edge of a cliff, watching the ships descend.

Nezha held a bottle of wine he had "liberated" from the King's private stash. He took a swig and passed it to Red Boy.

"They made it," Nezha said.

"They are soft," Red Boy grunted, taking a drink. "The Guard will make them soft again."

"Maybe," Nezha looked at the distant blue specks of the ships. "But they survived. That's enough."

He looked at Red Boy. The child-demon looked older now. The manic hunger was gone, replaced by a quiet, simmering intensity.

"So," Nezha said. "The truce ends when the last ship leaves?"

Red Boy looked at him. He summoned a small ball of Void fire in his hand.

"No," Red Boy said. "I'm tired of fighting you, Third Prince. You're... annoying. But useful."

"Useful?" Nezha laughed. "I'm the God of War!"

"I need to find the Monkey," Red Boy said. "And you have access to the Heavenly Archives. You can track him better than I can."

"You want to team up?" Nezha raised an eyebrow. "To hunt Wukong?"

"To find him," Red Boy corrected. "After that... whoever gets to kill him first wins."

Nezha considered it. Hunting the Great Sage with the Prince of Night? It was heresy. It was treason. It was the most exciting thing he had heard in five hundred years.

"Deal," Nezha grinned, clinking his bottle against Red Boy's horn.

"To the Monkey," Nezha toasted.

"To the end of the story," Red Boy replied.

They sat in silence, watching the last of the rescue ships lift off from the planet below, carrying the lost sparks back to the stars.
