title: "The Return of the Creators"
order: 12

The klaxons began at dawn, a mournful, mechanical wail that echoed through every level of the Beast-Man Metropolis. It wasn't the usual police siren or the rhythmic thrum of the atmospheric processors. This was the Planetary Defense Alarm, a sound that hadn't been heard in living memory.

Deep in the Genetic Archive, the sound was muffled but unmistakable. Zhu Bajie looked up from the diary, his brow furrowed. "Is the sky falling?"

Tybalt's ears flattened against his skull. "Worse. That's a Class-One Invasion Alert."

Before they could formulate a plan, the blast doors of their sanctuary shuddered. They hadn't been sealed properly—the ancient hydraulics were too damaged. A squad of heavily armored Rhinoceros-Men burst in, their kinetic rifles leveled. They weren't police; they were military press-gangs.

"By order of the High Council and the Planetary Defense Force," the lead Rhino bellowed, his voice amplified by a helmet speaker. "All able-bodied citizens are hereby conscripted for immediate service. Resistance is treason. Treason is punishable by death."

Alice reached for her pistol, but Bajie put a hand on her arm. There were too many of them, and their armor looked thick enough to stop a tank shell.

"We go quietly," Bajie whispered. "For now."

They were herded onto transport hover-barges along with thousands of others—Lion-Men, Wolf-Men, Bear-Men—anyone with the muscle mass to hold a heavy weapon. The destination was the Central Military Academy, a sprawling fortress of concrete and steel on the outskirts of the city.

The atmosphere was thick with panic. Rumors flew faster than the transport ships.

"It's the Creators," a nervous Rat-Man whispered to Bajie as they stood in line for processing. "They've come back."

"The humans?" Bajie asked, feigning ignorance.

"Who else?" the Rat-Man squeaked. "The radars picked them up past the asteroid belt. A hundred ships. Warships. They're coming to finish what they started a thousand years ago. They're coming to harvest us."

The fear was palpable. For a millennium, the humans had been the boogeymen of Beast-Man culture—the cruel gods who had twisted their DNA and then abandoned them to rot. The stories of the "Great Uplift" were not tales of benevolence, but of vivisection and slavery. The idea that the masters were returning sent a chill through even the toughest predators.

Bajie, Alice, and Tybalt were processed, stripped of their civilian clothes (though Bajie managed to hide the diary in a hidden pocket of his new uniform), and assigned to the 7th Assault Battalion.

"You look like you can take a hit," the drill sergeant, a scarred Crocodile-Man, sneered at Bajie. "Frontline Heavy Infantry."

"I prefer 'Marshal'," Bajie muttered, but he took the massive plasma cannon he was handed. It was heavy, crude compared to celestial weaponry, but it had a satisfying heft.

For the next three weeks, their life was a blur of brutal efficiency. They were drilled from sunrise to sunset. They learned to strip and clean plasma rifles, to throw gravity grenades, and to pilot the standard-issue "Iron Tusk" combat mechs—bipedal walkers armed with rotary cannons and missile pods.

Alice took to the training with frightening ease. Her agility and sharpshooting skills made her a natural in the scout mech class. Tybalt, despite his grumbling and his injured arm (which the military medics patched up with rough efficiency), fell back on his predatory instincts, excelling in close-quarters combat simulations.

Bajie, however, was the surprise.

"Maggot! You hold that cannon like a breadstick!" the sergeant screamed during live-fire practice.

Bajie sighed, hefted the fifty-kilogram weapon with one hand, and fired a single shot without looking. The target drone, moving at Mach 1 three kilometers away, vaporized in a cloud of blue fire.

"It pulls to the left," Bajie noted dryly. "And the recoil dampener is sticky."

The sergeant stared, his jaw unhinged.

But amidst the training, the dread grew. The holographic displays in the mess hall showed the approaching fleet. One hundred ships. Sleek, silver needles moving in a perfect formation. They didn't respond to hails. They didn't broadcast demands. They just approached, silent and inevitable.

"They're not just ships," Alice whispered one night in the barracks, looking at a stolen datapad. "I hacked the sensor logs. The energy readings... they're off the charts. They're using antimatter drives. We're bringing guns to a nuke fight."

"Why come back now?" Tybalt asked, sharpening his combat knife. "After a thousand years?"

"Maybe they never left," Bajie said softly, touching the diary through his uniform. "Or maybe they are looking for something they left behind."

He thought of the Genetic Archive. The preserved history. The diary. Was it possible the humans were returning for their own legacy? Or was it something darker?

The intercom crackled to life, cutting through the murmur of the barracks.

"Attention all personnel. Enemy fleet has breached the orbital perimeter. All units to battle stations. This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill."

The barracks erupted into chaos. Bajie stood up, grabbing his plasma cannon. He looked at Alice and Tybalt.

"Stay close to me," he said, his voice dropping the lazy facade, replaced by the tone of a general who had led eighty thousand water soldiers against the armies of chaos. "We survive this. We find the truth. And if these 'Creators' want a fight..."

He grinned, revealing his tusks.

"...I'll show them what a real monster looks like."
