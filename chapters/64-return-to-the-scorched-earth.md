# Chapter 64: Return to the Scorched Earth

The Flaming Mountain was no longer burning.

As Red Boy's black interceptor dropped out of warp, he looked down at his childhood home with a mix of confusion and disgust. The jagged, volcanic peaks that used to spew magma were now covered in moss. The sky, once a choking haze of sulfur, was clear and blue. Massive atmospheric scrubbers, branded with the Lotus Sigil of the Bodhisattva, floated in orbit, humming softly.

"Disgusting," Red Boy muttered. "They turned a fortress into a garden."

He didn't ask for landing clearance. He simply dived.

The orbital defense grid—a network of automated laser satellites—swiveled to track him.

"Unidentified vessel," the automated warning barked. "You are entering a demilitarized rehabilitation zone. Power down your engines or we will fire."

Red Boy didn't even blink. He reached out with his mind, the Shadow Flame surging through the ship's comms array.

"Sleep," he commanded.

The satellites simply died. Their lights went out, and they drifted aimlessly in the void.

The interceptor screamed through the atmosphere, the sonic boom shattering the newfound tranquility below. Red Boy aimed for the Emerald Cloud Palace—formerly the Fire Cloud Cave—where his parents now lived in their "retirement."

He landed in the main courtyard, the thrusters of his ship scorching the manicured flower beds.

The palace guards—bull-headed hybrids in ceremonial armor—rushed out, spears leveled.

"Halt!" the captain shouted. "State your business!"

Red Boy lowered the ship's ramp and walked out. The neutron-star armor absorbed the sunlight, making him look like a walking hole in reality. The Void Spear in his hand hummed with a sound that made teeth ache.

He didn't speak. He just walked.

A guard lunged. Red Boy didn't move his spear. A tendril of shadow lashed out from his shadow, grabbed the guard, and tossed him fifty feet into a stone pillar.

The other guards froze. They recognized the face behind the new, terrible power.

"Holy Prince?" one whispered.

"Get out of my way," Red Boy said softly.

The doors to the inner sanctum burst open. But it wasn't soldiers who came out.

It was a woman. She wore robes of soft silk, not armor. Her face was lined with worry, but her eyes held the same fierce spark that Red Boy remembered.

Princess Iron Fan.

She stopped at the top of the stairs, looking at the dark figure standing amidst the ruined flowers. She looked at the black armor, the pale skin, the violet eyes.

"Hong-er?" she whispered, her voice trembling.

Red Boy looked up at his mother. He tried to summon the anger, the disdain. But for a second, the Shadow Flame in his chest flickered.

"I'm home, Mother," he said. "But not to stay."
