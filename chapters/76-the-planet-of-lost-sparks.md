# Chapter 76: The Planet of Lost Sparks

Nezha followed the Void signature across three sectors. It was erratic, pulsing with rage.

He emerged from hyperspace in a system that wasn't on any starchart. It didn't have a sum, just a brown dwarf star that gave off barely enough heat to keep the physics of the system intact.

Orbiting it was a single, rusted world. *Planet Lament*.

From orbit, it looked like a festering wound. The surface was covered in smog so thick it was liquid. Factories the size of continents belched green smoke into the void.

"No military defenses," Nezha’s combat suite analyzed. "No automated turrets. But... massive biological output."

"Define biological," Nezha asked, floating in the vacuum, the heat of the yellow wind core still thrumming in his reinforced bones.

"Millions of distinct life signs. All confined. All... fading."

Nezha frowned. He ignited his blue-flame wheels and descended.

The atmosphere tasted of sulfur and burning copper. He landed on a catwalk overlooking a factory floor that stretched to the horizon. It was a labyrinth of pipes, conveyor belts, and massive glass vats.

And inside the vats were children.

They were suspended in yellow fluid, wires plugged into their temples and spines. There were human children, beast-man cubs, little crystalline crystalline entities from the Silica Sector, and aquatic larvae from the Deep Worlds.

They were all asleep. And they were all glowing faint, pulsating light.

The light was being drawn out of them, siphoned into massive turbines that powered the planet's industry.

"They aren't workers," Nezha realized, his grip tightening on his spear until the metal groaned. "They are fuel."

A booming laugh echoed through the smog.

"Fresh sparks," a voice gurgled. It sounded like someone drowning in oil. "But this one burns too hot for the tanks."

Nezha looked down. In the center of the factory stood a throne made of pipes and valves. Sitting on it was a monstrosity.

The Great King of Inspiration.

He was a biomechanical nightmare. Half shark, half steam-engine. His skin was wet, slick with black oil. His chest was a transparent furnace, burning with the stolen white light of a thousand souls.

And facing him, floating above the vats, was Red Boy.

The Holy Infant looked different. The arrogance was gone. His fists were clenched, shaking.

"Release them," Red Boy demanded. His voice wasn't the distorted echo of the Void. It was the voice of a child.

"Why?" The King of Inspiration smiled, revealing rows of serrated, rotating teeth. "They serve a purpose now. They power the Great Machine. Without them, this world dies."

"Then let it die," Red Boy screamed.

He raised his hand. "Samadhi Void: Erase."

A beam of black fire joy darker than the smog shot toward the King.

"Defense Protocol: Innocence," the King clicked a switch on his throne.

The vats surrounding the throne shifted. The fluid drained instantly. The children inside woke up, screaming in terror. The energy shield that sprang up around the King wasn't made of force fields. It was made of their pain.

Red Boy's fire hit the shield.

*SCREAM.*

The feedback didn't hit the King. It hit the children. A hundred vats cracked. The lights inside the kids flickered and went out.

Red Boy froze. He cut the beam instantly.

"You stop?" The King laughed. "I thought you were a demon, boy. I heard you ate your own parents. Why do you care about these sparks?"

"I am not... like you," Red Boy whispered.

"No. You are weak."

The King of Inspiration opened his jaw. A cannon barrel extended from his throat.

**"Soul Cannon: Maximum Output."**

A beam of concentrated, corrupted white light—the distilled despair of a million orphans—slammed into Red Boy.

Because he had hesitated, because he had canceled his attack to save the vats, Red Boy had no defenses ready.

The blast hit him square in the chest.

There was no explosion. Just the sound of breaking ribs and the smell of ozone. Red Boy was thrown backward, smashing through three layers of reinforced steel catwalks. He crashed into a pile of scrap metal, motionless.

"Delicious," The King licked his lips with an oily tongue. "A Void-touched spark. He will keep the furnace running for a century."

Mechanical claws descended from the ceiling, reaching for Red Boy’s broken body.

High above, on the observation deck, Nezha watched.

He should have been happy. His rival was defeated. The hunt was over.

But the fire in Nezha’s chest—the fire from the Earth’s core, and the fire of the Lotus—was burning with something that wasn't anger. It was disgust.

"You use children as shields?" Nezha whispered.

He slowly unslung the Universe Ring from his shoulder.

"That's cheating."

He stepped off the ledge.
