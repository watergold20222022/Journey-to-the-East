# Chapter 39: The Neural Node

For three days, Tang Seng lived like a prince of the old world, or perhaps a pet of the new.

Sentry-7 was an attentive host. The AI anticipated his biological needs with mathematical precision. When Tang Seng woke, a nutrient-rich meal synthesized from local flora was waiting. When he wished to bathe, the station's sonic showers cleansed him without wasting a drop of water.

The most startling change, however, was his attire. His Kasaya, though holy, was heavy and not suited for the humid climate of the rainforest.

"Guest, I have synthesized a survival suit based on your biometric data," Sentry-7 announced on the second morning.

The machine produced a bundle of fabric—or what looked like fabric. It was a smart-mesh, shimmering with a faint golden hue that mimicked his monk's robes but felt as light as silk. When Tang Seng put it on, the nanofibers tightened to fit his frame perfectly, regulating his body temperature against the jungle's heat. It was a marvel of the lost colony.

Yet, despite the comfort, the silence of the station weighed on him. Every time he looked at the empty sleeping pod in the corner, he thought of Wukong sleeping on a rock, or Bajie snoring against a tree. This safety felt like a betrayal.

"Sentry," Tang Seng said on the fourth morning, standing before the main console. "I cannot stay here."

"Your stress markers are elevated," Sentry-7 observed. "Is the environmental control insufficient? I can adjust the humidity."

"The environment is perfect," Tang Seng shook his head. "Too perfect. But my disciples... my family... they are out there. I feel it in my heart, even if I cannot sense them with my spirit."

He looked at the holographic display of the planet's surface. "You have scanners. Powerful ones. Can you find them? A monkey, a pig-man, and a giant with blue skin?"

"Scanning," Sentry-7 replied instantly. The hologram shifted, a grid of blue light sweeping across the topography surrounding the cave.

The hum of the processors grew louder, then faded.

"Scan complete," Sentry-7 reported. "In a radius of one thousand kilometers, I detect ninety-four thousand species of flora and fauna. However, I detect no genetic matches for the descriptions provided, nor any anomalous energy signatures consistent with 'cultivation' or 'magic'."

Tang Seng's shoulders slumped. "Nothing?"

"The dense bio-electric field of this planet interferes with long-range sensor telemetry," Sentry-7 explained. "My reach is limited."

"Then I must go look for them myself," Tang Seng said, gripping his staff. "Even if I have to walk the whole world."

"That would be inefficient," Sentry-7 interjected. "If you require global data, you should query the network directly."

Tang Seng paused. "Network? You mean a computer?"

"Not a digital one," the AI corrected. "This planet... Veridia Prime is not merely a collection of ecosystems. It is a singular, integrated biological neural network. The plants, the fungi, the root systems—they communicate. The planet is, effectively, a brain the size of a world."

The hologram zoomed out, showing glowing lines of energy connecting vast forests.

"The colonists called them 'Mother Trees'," Sentry-7 continued. "They act as the supercomputing nodes—the synapses of the planetary mind. They hold the memories of the forest. If your companions are on this planet, the Mother Tree will know. It feels every footstep."

Tang Seng stared at the map. "Where is this Mother Tree?"

A pulsing green dot appeared on the map, far to the west of their location.

"The nearest primary node is located approximately ten thousand li from here," Sentry-7 said. "The terrain is treacherous. While the fauna appears docile, the planet's immune system can be... reactive to intruders who do not belong."

"Ten thousand li," Tang Seng repeated. It was a daunting distance, especially without the White Dragon Horse or Wukong's cloud-somersault. But it was a direction. It was hope.

"I must go," Tang Seng said firmly. "Sentry, can you help me prepare?"

"I am programmed to assist the colony," Sentry-7 replied. "You are the only colonist I have. I will synthesize rations and a portable navigation unit for you. But be warned, Guest. The Mother Tree is not a machine. It does not answer queries with logic. It answers with... life."

Tang Seng smiled, a look of serene determination returning to his face. "My disciples and I have dealt with gods, demons, and kings. I suppose a tree is just another dignitary to visit."

He adjusted his new nano-Kasaya, the golden fabric shimmering.

"Thank you, Sentry. For the rest, and for the path."

As he stepped out of the cool, sterile air of the cave and back into the vibrant, humid embrace of the jungle, the silence no longer felt empty. It felt like a riddle waiting to be solved. Somewhere, ten thousand li away, the planet was thinking. And Tang Seng intended to have a conversation with it.
