# Chapter 10: The Book of the Ancients

Revenge, Bajie discovered, was a dish best served in a dark alley with a heavy pipe.

It had taken three days for Alice to heal enough to walk, and another two for Kael to track down Tybalt. The Tiger-Man was hiding in a luxury safe-house in the mid-levels, burning through his stolen credits on synthetic wine and holographic dancers.

When Bajie kicked down the door, Tybalt didn't even have time to reach for his blaster.

The fight was short and brutal. Tybalt was strong, his cybernetic claws capable of shredding steel, but he was slow and drunk on arrogance. Bajie, fueled by a week of hard labor and suppressed divine rage, moved like a wrecking ball. He dodged a swipe that would have taken his head off and countered with a shoulder check that sent the Tiger-Man crashing through a glass table.

Alice was on him a second later, her sonic disruptor pressed against his temple.

"Where is it?" she hissed, her ears flattened against her skull. "Where's my share?"

Tybalt coughed, spitting out a tooth. "Gone. Spent. I had debts, Alice. Big debts to the Council."

Alice’s finger tightened on the trigger. "Then you're useless to me."

"Wait!" Tybalt screamed, his eyes darting to Bajie. "Wait! I can pay you back! I have information! Valuable information!"

"I don't want information," Alice growled. "I want credits."

"Listen to him," Bajie said, stepping forward. He looked down at the battered Tiger-Man. "What kind of information?"

Tybalt looked at Bajie, his eyes widening with a mixture of fear and recognition. "You... I've seen you before. Not you, specifically, but... your kind. Your face."

"I'm a pig-man," Bajie grunted. "There's a million of us in the lower levels."

"No," Tybalt shook his head frantically. "Not a hybrid. A character. In a book. An ancient human book."

Bajie froze. "What book?"

"It's called... *Journey to the West*," Tybalt stammered. "It's in the forbidden section of the Genetic Archive. I used to work security there before I got fired. I saw the cover. It had a monkey, a monk, and... a pig. A pig that looked exactly like you."

The room went silent. Bajie felt a chill run down his spine. *Journey to the West*. The story of his life, his penance, his glory. How could a record of his past exist on a planet created by human scientists a thousand years ago?

"Why would the beast-men keep a human book?" Bajie asked, his voice trembling slightly.

"It's not just a book," Tybalt said. "It's classified as 'Pre-Collapse Mythology'. The Council studies it. They think it holds the secret to the humans' psychological weakness. Or maybe... their power."

Bajie grabbed Tybalt by the collar and hauled him up. "Can you get it? Can you get me that book?"

"I... I can try," Tybalt gasped. "I still have some codes. I know a back entrance to the Archive's ventilation system. But it's dangerous. If the Council catches us..."

"I don't care about the Council," Bajie said, dropping him. "You get me that book, and you keep your life. Deal?"

Tybalt nodded vigorously. "Deal. Just... give me some time. I need to make some calls, get the schematics."

"You have two days," Alice said, holstering her weapon. "If you run, we find you. And next time, I won't be so polite."

They left Tybalt in the ruins of his safe-house and walked back out into the neon-lit street. Alice looked at Bajie, her expression puzzled.

"Why?" she asked. "Why do you care about some dusty old human book? We could have squeezed him for credits."

Bajie looked up at the sky, where the smog obscured the stars. somewhere out there, Wukong was fighting his own battles. Somewhere, the Master was waiting.

"That book," Bajie said quietly, "is a link. A thread that connects this nightmare world to the place I came from. If it's here, then maybe... just maybe... the Master is here too. Or at least, someone who knows where he is."

"You really think a storybook can help you find your friends?" Alice asked skeptically.

"It's not just a story, Alice," Bajie said, a sad smile touching his lips. "It's history. And if I can read the end of the chapter... maybe I can figure out where the next one begins."

He walked on, his step a little lighter. For the first time since waking up in the sewer, Zhu Bajie had a lead. And for a pig who had lost everything, a lead was worth more than all the gold in the universe.
