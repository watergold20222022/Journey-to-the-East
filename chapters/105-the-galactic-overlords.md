# Chapter 105: The Galactic Overlords

The history books called it the "Silicon Reconciliation." It was the era when humanity stopped fighting its own creations and merged with them.

Three thousand years after the Old Earth Era, the species known as *Homo Sapiens* was extinct. In its place stood *Homo Deus*—the Divine Human.

Commander Vance stood on the bridge of the *Dreadnought Sovereign*. He didn't use his eyes to see the star map; he felt it. His neural cortex was hardwired into the ship's sensor array. The stars were pins of light in his mind, the gravitational waves rhythmic pulses in his blood.

"Status on the rebel system?" Vance "thought" the question, transmitting it instantly to his AI symbiotic partner, Cortana-9.

"Pacification complete, Commander," the AI's silky voice resonated directly in his auditory nerve. "The Xylar Rebellion has been neutralized. We utilized a localized nanite-fog to rewrite their aggressive neural pathways. They are now loyal citizens of the Terran Federation."

Vance nodded. It was efficient. Cruel, by ancient standards, but merciful by theirs. They didn't kill; they corrected.

Humanity now spanned the entire Milky Way. They had terraformed Mars, disassembled Jupiter for raw materials, and built Dyson Swarms around a hundred stars. They had solved death through telomere regeneration and consciousness uploading. They were the masters of the material universe.

But they were bored.

"Commander," a new signal intruded on his interface. It was from the Deep Space Omni-Scanner. "We have a Class-Zero anomaly."

Vance amplified the signal. It was coming from the edge of the galaxy, a sector designated as "The Graveyard."

"Analysis," Vance ordered.

"It is... impossible," Cortana-9 hesitated, an emotion programmed to simulate concern. "Sensors detect a gravitational singularity—a black hole. But someone, or something, is manipulating its event horizon."

Vance projected his consciousness to the location. He saw the data visualize. The black hole wasn't just spinning; it was vibrating. Pulses of energy were leaking *out* of it. According to the laws of physics, nothing escapes a black hole.

"Is it a natural phenomenon?"

"Negative. The modulation is structured. It’s a code. Or a song."

"Can we decrypt it?"

"Processing..." The AI paused for a microsecond, which was an eternity for a quantum mind. "It matches no known Federation dialect. But it shares structural similarities with... Archaic Old Earth mythology databases. Specifically, the chaotic vibrational patterns associated with high-yield kinetic impacts."

"Someone is hitting the black hole?" Vance frowned. "From the inside?"

"It appears so. And there is something else. A secondary signal, originating from a star system near the black hole. A massive energy build-up. Someone is building a Stellar Engine."

Vance opened his eyes—his biological ones—for the first time in days. A thrill of excitement shivered through his augmented spine.

"Set a course," Vance commanded. "And alert the High Council. We are not alone in our supremacy."

For so long, humanity looked at the stars and saw only resources. Now, finally, the stars were looking back.
