# Chapter 45: Shadows in the Mist

The journey South was a descent into a dream that was slowly turning into a nightmare. As they moved away from the orderly sanctuary of the Mother Tree, the jungle became wilder, darker, and more surreal.

Tang Seng walked in the middle of their small formation. Sentry-7 took the lead, its monofilament cutter hacking through vines that seemed to bleed purple sap when severed. Ao Lie brought up the rear, his silver sword glowing faintly in the gloom.

But the real challenge wasn't the terrain; it was the atmosphere. The air here was heavy with spores that shimmered like gold dust. They distorted the light, creating phantoms in the peripheral vision.

"Master," Ao Lie warned, "do not look directly at the Gasbag Beetles."

Tang Seng looked up and saw them—creatures the size of pumpkins floating aimlessly among the trees. They were translucent, and inside their bodies, he could see swirling gasses that formed patterns resembling human faces. As he watched, one of them drifted closer, the gas inside shifting to form a face that looked startlingly like Bajie, grinning and drooling over a meal.

"Brother?" Tang Seng whispered, reaching out.

"It is a mimicry response," Sentry-7 stated, its voice cutting through the illusion. "The beetles reflect the synaptic desires of the observer to lure them into spore range. It is not real."

Tang Seng pulled his hand back, a pang of sorrow piercing his chest. "Not real," he murmured. "Of course."

They continued walking. The silence of the group was heavy. In the old days—was it only weeks ago?—the journey was never this quiet. Bajie would be complaining about his feet or asking when lunch was. Wukong would be teasing him, jumping from tree to tree, his laughter ringing through the mountains. Sha Wujing would be plodding along, offering steady, comforting remarks.

Now, there was only the hum of Sentry's servos and the soft tread of the Dragon Prince's boots.

Tang Seng looked at a cluster of flowers that resembled trumpets. As he passed, they let out a low, mournful toot. It sounded exactly like the wind whistling through the ruins of the Fire Cloud Cave.

"Wukong always scouted ahead," Tang Seng said softly, more to himself than to his companions. "He would draw a circle on the ground to keep me safe. He would smell a demon a thousand miles away."

He gripped his staff tighter. "I scolded him so often. I told him he was too violent, too impulsive. I used the Tightening Curse on him."

Tears pricked his eyes. "I never thanked him for the circles."

"The Great Sage knows your heart, Master," Ao Lie said gently from behind. "He never held a grudge. Well... not a long one."

Tang Seng smiled sadly. "He was the heart of our journey. Without him, I feel... exposed. Not just to the monsters, but to the silence."

Ahead, the path was blocked by a creature that looked like a stag, but its antlers were made of fluid, shifting crystal. It stared at Tang Seng with eyes that held centuries of sadness. It didn't move. It simply radiated a feeling of intense loneliness.

Tang Seng stopped. He felt the creature's emotion washing over him, mixing with his own.

"It is lost, too," Tang Seng whispered.

"It is a Mirror Stag," Sentry-7 analyzed. "It feeds on melancholy. We should bypass it."

"No," Tang Seng said. He stepped forward, ignoring Sentry's warning beep. He bowed to the stag.

"We are all travelers," Tang Seng said to the beast. "We all carry burdens. But dwelling on the shadow only makes the night darker."

The stag blinked. The crystal antlers stopped shifting. Slowly, it turned and bounded away into the mist, the oppressive feeling of sadness lifting slightly with it.

"You have a strange power, Master," Ao Lie noted. "You fight with words where even my sword would fail."

"It is not power, Ao Lie," Tang Seng sighed, resuming his walk. "It is just... recognition. I see myself in them."

He looked toward the jagged peaks of the Stone Valley rising in the distance. The "echo" of the Fire-Ape was waiting there. A broken memory.

"Wukong," Tang Seng thought, looking at the alien sky. "If that is you... or a part of you... waiting in the pain... I am coming. I will not draw a circle to keep you out. I will walk into the fire to bring you home."
