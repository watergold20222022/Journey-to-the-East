The autopsy of the alien drone was a sterile, silent affair. In the high-security labs beneath the Planetary Defense Headquarters, Beast-Man scientists in hazmat suits dissected the liquid metal carcass with laser scalpels.

Zhu Bajie, Alice, and Tybalt stood behind the observation glass, watching alongside General Rakafa.

"We've cracked the core processor," the lead scientist, a bespectacled Owl-Man, announced over the intercom. "Or rather, we've read the surface data. The encryption is too dense for a deep dive, but we found something... disturbing."

"Spit it out," Rakafa rumbled, his arms crossed over his massive chest.

"There are no life support systems on their ships, General," the Owl-Man said, his feathers ruffled with anxiety. "No atmosphere, no gravity plating, no food stores. The fleet isn't carrying an invasion force of humans."

"Then who is flying them?" Tybalt asked.

"No one," the scientist replied. "The fleet *is* the invasion force. It's a fully automated armada. Artificial Intelligence. A Silicon Legion."

A heavy silence fell over the room. The fear of the "Creators" returning had been built on the memory of cruel masters with whips and scalpels. But this was different. This was a cold, mathematical extinction.

"They aren't here to harvest us," Alice whispered, her face pale. "They're here to delete us."

Later, in the War Room, the atmosphere was toxic with indecision. The Council of Generals—a Lion, a Wolf, and a Bear—were shouting over each other.

"We must dig in!" the Bear General roared, slamming his fist on the holographic map. "Fortify the cities! Turn the Metropolis into a bunker!"

"And starve to death while they bombard us from orbit?" the Wolf General snarled. "We need to launch a preemptive strike! Send every fighter we have!"

"Suicide!" the Lion General countered. "Their shields are too strong. We'd be swatting flies with a sledgehammer."

Rakafa stood silent at the head of the table, his eyes closed. He looked like a statue of a minotaur carved from granite. Bajie watched him, seeing the burden of command weighing down those massive shoulders.

"General," Alice spoke up. Her voice was small in the cavernous room, but it cut through the shouting.

The Generals turned to glare at the lowly Lieutenant. Rakafa opened his eyes. "Speak, Lieutenant."

"The drones," Alice said, stepping forward. "They communicate via a hive-mind network. Constant data streams. Identification, location, status updates."

"We know this," the Wolf General dismissed. "It's uncrackable."

"We don't need to crack it," Alice said, her eyes gleaming with a dangerous intelligence. "We just need to mimic it. We have the transponder from the drone Bajie smashed. It's damaged, but the IFF—Identification Friend or Foe—signal is still broadcasting."

She pointed to the map. "If we install that transponder into a shuttle, we could fly right past their perimeter defenses. They wouldn't see a Beast-Man ship. They'd see a returning drone."

"A Trojan Horse," Bajie murmured, nodding. "Oldest trick in the book. And usually the best."

"You want to infiltrate a fleet of killer robots?" Tybalt asked, looking at her like she was insane. "And do what? Ask them nicely to leave?"

"We plant a virus," Alice said. "Or a bomb. Or we find the command ship and shut it down. If it's a hive mind, there has to be a Queen."

The room went quiet. The Generals looked at each other, skepticism warring with desperation.

"It is a suicide mission," Rakafa said finally. His voice was low, devoid of the bluster of the other commanders.

"Staying here is suicide," Bajie said, stepping up beside Alice. "If we wait, we die. If we attack head-on, we die. This is the only way to win."

He looked at Rakafa. "Give us a ship. Give us the transponder. We'll get it done."

Rakafa looked at Bajie for a long moment. He saw the fire in the pig-man's eyes, a fire that hadn't been there when he was just a refugee in the slums. He saw a warrior.

"The Council is dismissed," Rakafa announced suddenly.

"But General—" the Bear started.

"Dismissed!" Rakafa bellowed, his voice shaking the walls. The Generals scrambled out of the room.

When they were alone, Rakafa walked over to a secure terminal. "I have a stealth shuttle. Prototype. It's fast, small, and has no weapons. We can retrofit the drone's transponder into its hull."

He looked at the three of them. "You are not just soldiers anymore. You are the tip of the spear. If you fail, there will be no one left to mourn you."

"We won't fail," Bajie said, hefting his rake. "I've broken into the Heavenly Palace before. A few flying toasters won't stop me."

"Heavenly Palace?" Rakafa raised an eyebrow.

"Long story," Bajie grinned. "I'll tell you over a drink when we get back."

Rakafa chuckled, a dry, dusty sound. "It's a deal, Captain. Prepare your team. You launch at 0200 hours."

As they left to prep for the mission, Tybalt shook his head. "I was a thief. Then a traitor. Now I'm a hero on a suicide mission. Life is funny."

"It's not about being a hero," Bajie said, looking up at the stars where the silent fleet waited. "It's about survival. And maybe... maybe finding some answers."

He patted the diary tucked into his flight suit. The Master's words were his armor now. And he was taking the fight to the enemy.
