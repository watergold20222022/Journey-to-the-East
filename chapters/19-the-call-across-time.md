Light-years away, in the silent, crystalline orbit of Planet Kunlun, Sun Wukong sat in the lotus position atop the hull of the *Ox-Tail*. The vacuum of space was his meditation chamber. He had been here for weeks, drifting in the Void of Primordial Data, waiting for a sign, a whisper, anything from Nuwa.

Suddenly, his eyes snapped open.

A jolt ran through his spirit—a feeling he hadn't experienced in centuries. It was a phantom weight in his right hand, a ghostly vibration that traveled up his arm and settled in his heart. It was the feeling of a connection re-established.

"Old friend," Wukong whispered, his voice carried by telepathy to the ship's sensors.

He scrambled back into the airlock, his golden armor clanking against the hull.

"Niu-Nav!" he barked as he entered the bridge. "Scan for quantum entanglement signatures! Specifically, a unique mass-energy displacement matching the *Ruyi Jingu Bang*."

The AI navigator projected a holographic sphere of the galaxy. "Searching... Anomaly detected. Resonance confirmed. But... this is strange, Great Sage."

"What's strange?" Wukong demanded, leaning over the console. "Where is it?"

"It is... everywhere and nowhere," Niu-Nav replied, its synthesized voice sounding confused. "The signal is emanating from a set of coordinates in the Kara Sector, but the temporal variance is off the charts. It's not just a spatial distance. It's a dimensional shift."

"Speak plain, cow-bot," Wukong growled.

"The weapon is in a parallel timeline," Niu-Nav clarified. "Or a pocket dimension that is out of phase with our current reality. We can see it, we can measure it, but we cannot reach it. The *Ox-Tail* is a stealth scout, not a chrono-hopper. We lack the temporal drive to breach the barrier."

Wukong slammed his fist onto the console, leaving a dent. "So it's there, but I can't get to it. And if my staff is there, then Bajie must be nearby. I felt him touch it."

He paced the small bridge, his tail twitching with agitation. To be so close, yet separated by the walls of time itself. It was the Five Finger Mountain all over again, but this time the cage was the universe.

"There must be a way," Wukong muttered. "Nuwa said I had to find my 'original self'. Maybe that's the key."

He flew down to the surface of Planet Kunlun. He wandered through the forests of crystal trees and rivers of liquid mercury. He shouted Nuwa's name to the aurora-filled sky.

"Goddess! Mother! Show yourself!"

Silence.

He traveled to the Great Library, where the history of a billion worlds was stored in shards of glass. He smashed through the archives, looking for a manual on time travel, a spell, a loophole in the laws of physics.

Nothing.

The planet was a tomb of knowledge, beautiful and cold. There were no people here. No sages to consult. No demons to bully into submission. Just the endless, glittering silence of a dead civilization.

Wukong sat on a cliff overlooking a sea of static-charged clouds. For the first time since his rebirth, he felt truly helpless. His strength, which could lift mountains and shake the heavens, was useless against the barrier of time.

"I am the Monkey King," he said to the empty air. "I do not accept 'impossible'."

He closed his eyes and reached out with his spirit, trying to force the connection, to send a message back to the staff, back to Bajie.

*Hold on, idiot,* he projected with all his will. *I'm coming. I just... I just need to figure out how.*

But the only answer was the wind howling through the crystal canyons, mocking the Great Sage Equal to Heaven with its emptiness.
