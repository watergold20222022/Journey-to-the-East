Wukong didn't bother looking for a doorbell. He walked up to the base of the glowing green pyramid, which hummed with a low, nauseating frequency, and tapped it with the tip of his Golden Staff.

*Tap.*

The ice groaned. Cracks spiderwebbed outward from the point of impact, glowing with unnerving witch-light.

"Is anyone home?" Wukong shouted, his voice amplified by his own internal power. "We're here to pick up a package! Sign for delivery!"

The response was immediate. The smooth walls of the pyramid didn't open; they *burst*.

Hundreds of creatures poured out from the breaches like pus from a wound. They screeched and roared, a cacophony of madness that drowned out the howling wind.

"Incoming!" Alice yelled, dropping to one knee and unleashing a barrage of plasma fire.

The first wave was airborne. Massive, mutated snowy owls—the "Frost-Winged Shriekers." Their wingspans were thirty feet across, but their feathers had been replaced by jagged shards of transparent ice. They didn't fly; they cut through the air.

One shrieked, diving at Wukong. It opened its beak to unleash a sonic boom that cracked the ground.

"Too loud!" Wukong laughed. He leaped straight into the sonic wave, spinning his staff into a golden shield. He punched through the sound barrier and slammed the staff onto the bird's skull. It exploded in a shower of blue gore and ice shards.

On the ground, Bajie was facing a nightmare.

Lumbering toward him were "Tusked Behemoths"—mutated walruses that had been twisted into bipedal tanks. Their blubber was covered in thick, necrotic armored plates, and their tusks had elongated into four-meter swirling bone lances dripping with green venom.

"Disgusting!" Bajie shouted. A Behemoth lunged, its tusks aiming for his belly. Bajie sidestepped with surprising grace, hooking his Nine-Toothed Rake behind the creature's knee joints. "Sit down!"

He yanked the rake. The multi-ton monster crashed face-first into the ice. Bajie stomped on its neck, the force creating a shockwave that knocked two smaller monsters back.

"Watch the flanks!" Tianji warned.

Swarming around the heavy hitters were "Shadow Biters"—arctic foxes that had been stripped of their fur and elongated into skeletal, muscular nightmares. Their jaws unhinged like snakes, revealing rows of needle-teeth. They moved like oil, slipping past Alice's shots.

"I got them!" Wukong yelled. He plucked a handful of hair from his arm and blew on it. *Poof.*

Dozens of mini-Wukongs appeared, each wielding a glowing staff. They descended on the fox-monsters like a golden swarm, bonking heads and tying tails together. The battlefield became a chaotic dance of golden light and green monster ichor.

Wukong was a whirlwind of violence. He didn't just fight; he played. He vaulted off a Behemoth's tusk, kicked a Shrieker out of the air, and landed perfectly on the head of another monster, driving it into the ground like a nail.

"Is that all?" Wukong roared, slamming his staff into the ice. "I haven't even warmed up!"

With the alpha monsters dead, the remaining creatures faltered. Their hive-mind connection seemed to snap. They whimpered, turning on each other or fleeing back into the pyramid.

"Clear," Alice panted, checking her heat sink. It was smoking.

Tianji walked calmly into the field of carnage. He knelt beside the corpse of a Tusked Behemoth. A laser scalpel extended from his finger, slicing into the creature's thick neck.

"Analysis complete," the robot said, his voice grave.

"What are they?" Bajie asked, wiping slime off his rake. "Demons?"

"Biologically, yes. Genetically... no," Tianji projected a DNA helix into the cold air. It was a mess of broken strands and forced splices. "This is an Arctic Walrus. But its genetic code has been rewritten. Not by CRISPR or retro-viruses... but by brute force."

"Brute force?" Alice asked.

"The cellular structure has been flooded with an unknown energy source that forces rapid mutation," Tianji explained. "It ignores the laws of biology. It forces the flesh to grow weapons, bone armor, and venom sacs in a matter of hours. It consumes the host's life force to fuel the change."

He pointed to the Shreikers. "These birds died of old age the moment you killed them. Their metabolism was running at 10,000% capacity."

Wukong frowned, looking at the twisted bodies. "This isn't science. I've seen this before."

"You have?" Alice asked.

"In the old days," Wukong said quietly. "Demon Kings would use dark magic to turn mountain rats and wolves into soldiers. They didn't care if the creatures suffered. They just wanted meat for the grinder."

He looked up at the glowing green pyramid.

"Someone in there has the power of creation," Wukong said, his eyes burning gold. "But they're using it to make monsters. That's a corruption of the Dao."

"Who has that kind of power?" Bajie asked. "Nuwa?"

"Nuwa creates to give life," Wukong gripped his staff. "This guy creates to deal death. Let's go ask him why."

He marched toward the shattered entrance of the pyramid, stepping over the bodies of the twisted guardians. The real fight was just beginning.
