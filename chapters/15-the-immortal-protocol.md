The silence of space was deceptive. Inside the stealth shuttle *Gao-1*, the tension was a physical pressure. Zhu Bajie sat at the controls, his large hands surprisingly steady as he guided the small craft toward the massive, geometric silhouette of the AI Command Carrier.

"Transponder active," Alice whispered from the sensor station. Her eyes were fixed on the holographic display. "We're pinging as *Drone Unit 774-Bravo*. They're opening the hangar bay."

"Steady now," Tybalt muttered, checking his shock-baton. "One wrong twitch and we're space-dust."

The shuttle glided into the yawning maw of the carrier. As soon as the atmospheric shield shimmered behind them, Bajie didn't wait for the landing gear to lock. He kicked the hatch open.

"Go! Go! Go!"

The infiltration was a blur of violence. The hangar was occupied by rows of dormant drones and repair bots. They weren't prepared for an organic assault from within their own ranks. Bajie swung his nine-toothed rake, not as a farm tool, but as a whirlwind of destruction, smashing through silicon and sparks. Alice and Tybalt were efficient, their training with the Special Ops unit paying off as they secured the perimeter with EMP grenades and neuro-synapse scramblers.

Within minutes, the hangar was theirs.

"We need to get to the Central Core," Alice said, gasping for breath. "If we shut down the Hive Mind, the whole fleet drops like a stone."

But the Super AI, a vast intelligence known in the human logs as *ARES-9*, was not slow to react. A red light flooded the corridors, and a high-pitched frequency began to hum through the air.

"Warning," a cold, synthesized voice echoed through the ship. "Biological contamination detected. Initiating Purge Protocol: C-7."

A greenish gas began to hiss from the ceiling vents.

"Gas!" Tybalt yelled, pulling his mask over his face. "Masks on!"

But the mask was useless. This wasn't a standard chemical agent.

"It's... it's a retrovirus," Alice choked out, her hands clawing at her throat. She collapsed to her knees, her fox-ears twitching spasmodically. "It's targeted... specifically to... Beast-Man DNA..."

Tybalt fell beside her, his muscles seizing. The neuro-toxin was designed by the ancient human creators specifically to neutralize their rebellious experiments. It attacked the very genes that gave them their sapience.

Bajie watched in horror as his friends writhed on the floor. He turned to the vents, waiting for the toxin to take hold of him. He felt the cold mist enter his lungs, felt the microscopic hunters seeking out his genetic code.

Nothing happened.

The toxin searched for Beast-Man markers, but it found something else entirely. It found the DNA of a celestial deity, an immortal being whose essence had been forged in the Dao and tempered in the Heavenly Peach Garden. To the human virus, Bajie's biology was not an animal-hybrid—it was an anomaly, a divine constant that could not be rewritten.

"I am not a lab rat," Bajie growled.

He looked at his fallen comrades, then at the heavy blast doors leading to the core. A surge of white-hot fury, a remnant of his days as the Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy, erupted from his chest. He didn't need the mech. He didn't need the plasma cannon.

He reached deep inside, past the pig fat and the laziness, and grasped the core of his true power. His nine-toothed rake began to glow with a terrifying, celestial light.

*BOOM.*

The blast doors didn't just open; they disintegrated.

Bajie marched through the toxic fog, a demon of light. He reached the Central Core—a sphere of pulsing data-filaments the size of a building. Thousands of AI drones hovered around it, their red eyes turning toward him.

"EXTERMINATE," they chanted in unison.

"Try me," Bajie hissed.

He leaped. In mid-air, he grew in size, his armor manifesting from pure spirit-form. He became a giant of myth, a titan in the heart of a machine world. He swung his rake in a massive arc, a wave of spiritual energy rippling outward. The drones didn't just break; they dissolved into binary code and smoke.

He reached the center of the sphere and plunged his rake into the pulsing heart of *ARES-9*.

"PROTOCOL: OVERRIDE," Bajie shouted.

The AI screamed—not a vocal sound, but a digital shriek that echoed through the entire fleet. The data-filaments turned from red to white, then went dark. The hum of the ship died. The neurological toxin stopped flowing.

Six hours later, the skies above the Beast-Man Metropolis were filled with silent, silver ships. But they weren't firing. They were being towed into orbit by the Planetary Defense Force. Every drone had been deactivated, every AI sub-routine overwritten by the surge of celestial energy Bajie had unleashed.

The "Creators" had not returned as gods, but as empty shells, now the property of the people they had once sought to destroy.

The victory parade was the largest in the planet's history. Millions of Beast-Men lined the streets, cheering as the Special Ops shuttle landed in the Great Plaza.

When the hatch opened, Alice and Tybalt stepped out, looking pale but alive. They were followed by Zhu Bajie.

He wasn't wearing his military uniform. He was back in his simple tunic, his rake resting on his shoulder.

General Rakafa stepped forward, his horns gleaming in the sun. He didn't salute. He knelt.

"You saved us all, Captain," Rakafa said, his voice echoing through the silent plaza. "You are more than a soldier. You are a legend."

The crowd erupted. "BAJIE! BAJIE! THE PIG-KING!"

Bajie looked out at the sea of faces—the hybrids, the experiments, the "monsters" who just wanted to live. He felt the weight of the diary in his pocket. He had saved a world, but his own journey was far from over.

"I'm just a traveller," Bajie said softly, his voice amplified by the plaza's speakers. "And I'm still looking for my Master."

He looked up at the deactivated human fleet. He had the ships now. He had the tech. And most importantly, he had the hero's mandate.

The Journey to the East was no longer a flight of a refugee. It was the mission of a champion.
