# Chapter 73: The Eye of the Yellow Wind

System 81-X was a nightmare of stellar dynamics.

It was a binary star system—two dying orange giants locked in a gravitational death spiral. As they stripped plasma from each other, they generated a constant, screaming solar wind that flooded the entire system with ionized sulfur and gold dust.

To the naked eye, it looked like a storm of yellow fog that spanned millions of kilometers.

The *Red Armillary* bucked and shook as it hit the outer turbulence layer.

"Shields at 80%," the AI warned. "The particulate density is comparable to a sandstorm. Visibility is near zero."

"I don't need eyes," Nezha said, his hands flying across the holographic controls. "I need a lock."

The sensor display was a mess of static. The magnetic interference from the twin stars was blinding every long-range scanner.

"Isolate the Void signature," Nezha commanded. "Look for the silence in the noise."

The computer chirped. A vector appeared on the HUD. It pointed straight into the heart of the storm between the two stars.

"Got you," Nezha whispered.

But then, a second alarm blared.

"Warning: Massive biological signal detected. Class: Titan."

Nezha paused. "Titan class? Describe."

"It is... shifting. Composed of the storm itself. High-density nanotechnology mixed with biological matter. It is the ruling entity of this system."

"The Yellow Wind King," Nezha recalled the database entry. A warlord who had modified himself into a living weather system.

"The Void signature is moving *toward* the Titan signal," the AI reported.

Nezha laughed. "Of course. The kid isn't hiding. He's picking a fight with the biggest thing in the room."

This complication was... acceptable. If Red Boy was fighting the Yellow Wind King, he would be distracted. It was the perfect time for a third party to enter the fray and claim the prize.

"Arm all weapons," Nezha ordered. "Prepare the Fire-tipped Spear for close-quarters engagement. And prime the Wind Fire Wheels for atmospheric entry."

"Sir," the AI hesitated. "Entering the accretion disc of binary stars is suicide. The radiation alone—"

"I am the Third Lotus Prince," Nezha interrupted. "Radiation is just spicy light."

He pushed the throttle forward.

The *Red Armillary* dove into the yellow maelstrom. The viewports turned a blinding, opaque gold. The ship groaned under the pressure of the solar wind.

Nezha felt the familiar thrill of battle rising in his chest. It was better than the simulation. Better than the memory. This was real.

Somewhere in that blinding storm was the monster that ruled the wind. And somewhere in that storm was the boy who ended stories.

Nezha’s eyes glowed with fusion fire.

"Ready or not," he whispered. "Here comes the thunder."
