# Chapter 6: The Beast-Man Metropolis

Zhu Bajie awoke to the smell of industrial waste and rotting algae.

He was face-down in a thick, black sludge that tasted of copper and old grease. As he pushed himself up, his heavy, porcine hands sinking into the muck, he realized he wasn't on the Flaming Mountain anymore. He was in a tunnel—a massive, vaulted sewer line made of cracked concrete and rusted steel. Above him, the sound of heavy traffic rumbled through the ceiling, a rhythmic thrum that vibrated in his tusks.

"Master? Monkey? Anyone?" he croaked, his voice echoing off the damp walls.

There was no answer. Only the drip of toxic runoff and the distant hum of machinery.

Bajie waddled through the sludge, his belly dragging in the mire. He found a drainage grate that led out toward a blindingly bright horizon. He emerged onto a beach, but it wasn't a beach of sand. It was a shoreline of crushed glass and microplastics, lapped by waves of iridescent, oily water.

In the distance, a city rose like a jagged crown of neon and chrome. Skyscrapers pierced the smog-filled sky, their sides covered in massive holographic advertisements for synthetic proteins and neural implants.

Bajie knelt by the water’s edge, trying to wash the filth from his face. As the oil cleared, he saw his reflection in the shimmering surface. The pig-like snout, the floppy ears, the small, squinted eyes.

"Ugh," he muttered, splashing the water away. "Even in another dimension, I'm still the ugliest thing in the room. If I walk into that city looking like this, they'll turn me into synthetic bacon before I can say 'Amitabha'."

He closed his eyes and focused. He tapped into the 36 Transformations—the ancient protocols that allowed him to rewrite his physical appearance. It felt sluggish, like trying to run a high-end program on a dying battery, but eventually, the code took hold. His skin smoothed, his snout receded, and his frame shifted from a bloated mass to a tall, athletic build with sharp, handsome features.

He stood up, admiring his new, human hands. "Much better. Now, let's find some food and a way out of this dump."

He walked toward the city, crossing a bridge that led into the main thoroughfare. But as he stepped onto the crowded street, the air suddenly felt cold.

The city was teeming with life, but it wasn't human life.

A woman with the head of a sleek panther walked by, her tail twitching beneath a designer coat. A group of construction workers with the massive, grey hides of rhinos were lifting steel beams with their bare hands. A shopkeeper with the multi-faceted eyes of a dragonfly watched him from behind a counter.

This was a metropolis of beast-men—hybrids of every conceivable species, living in a high-tech, urban sprawl.

And then, they saw him.

The panther-woman stopped. The rhino-men dropped their beams. The dragonfly-shopkeeper’s eyes clicked in unison.

"A Pure-Blood!" someone shouted.

"An Un-Modified!" another voice screamed.

To Bajie’s horror, the crowd didn't look at him with admiration. They looked at him with a mixture of primal hunger and fanatical rage. In this world, a "normal" human was a freak, a relic of a forgotten era, or perhaps a rare delicacy.

"Get him!" a wolf-headed enforcer roared, drawing a stun-baton that crackled with blue electricity.

Bajie panicked. "Wait! I'm not... I'm just a traveler! I'm looking for a monk!"

The crowd surged forward. Bajie reached for his Nine-Toothed Rake, the weapon forged from divine iron that could level mountains. He visualized the command, the mental trigger that should have summoned the weapon from his personal sub-space.

Nothing happened.

He tried to cast a gust of wind to blow the attackers back. He felt the energy gather in his chest, but it dissipated into a harmless puff of smoke. The local reality-matrix was different here; his magic was being suppressed by the city’s pervasive electromagnetic fields, or perhaps the Samadhi vortex had damaged his internal circuits.

"Oh, bother," Bajie squealed.

He turned and ran. He was fast in his human form, but the beast-men were faster. A cheetah-man blurred past him, nearly tripping him. A hawk-man dived from a balcony, his talons grazing Bajie’s shoulder.

He dived into a narrow, dark alleyway, the sounds of the mob echoing behind him. He was trapped. A dead end.

"Think, Bajie, think!" he hissed.

He realized that his "handsome" transformation was the very thing that was killing him. In a world of monsters, the monster is the only one who belongs.

He focused again, reversing the transformation. It was painful this time, his bones cracking and his skin stretching as the pig-form returned. He felt the familiar weight of his belly, the coarseness of his bristles.

He huddled behind a stack of discarded shipping crates, his heart racing.

The mob reached the mouth of the alley. The wolf-enforcer shone a high-intensity flashlight into the darkness. The beam swept over the crates, illuminating Bajie’s porcine face for a split second.

"Where did he go?" the cheetah-man asked, sniffing the air.

"All I smell is garbage and... is that pork?" the wolf-enforcer grunted, looking directly at Bajie.

Bajie froze, holding his breath. He looked like just another beast-man, a low-tier pig-hybrid hiding in the slums.

"The Pure-Blood must have jumped the fence," the wolf-enforcer decided, turning away. "Keep searching! The Council pays a fortune for a live one!"

The mob moved on, their voices fading into the city’s ambient roar.

Bajie slumped against the crates, his snout twitching with fear and exhaustion. He was alone in a city that hated his true self and hunted his false one. He had no weapon, no magic, and no idea where his friends were.

"Master," he whispered, a single tear rolling down his snout. "I think I'd rather be back on the Flaming Mountain."

He looked up at the neon signs flickering above the alley. One of them, a cracked holographic display, showed a map of the city. At the center was a massive spire labeled: **THE GENETIC ARCHIVE**.

If there was any record of how he got here, or where the others might be, it was in that spire. But to get there, he would have to survive a city where being "human" was a death sentence.
