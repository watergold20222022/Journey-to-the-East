# Chapter 9: The Betrayal of the Tiger

The Underground Market was a labyrinth of shadows and neon, but even in the deepest pits of Planet Kara, faith found a way to survive.

Zhu Bajie had been wandering the lower levels, looking for a quiet place to eat his meager ration of synth-bread, when he saw it. Tucked between a shop selling illegal cyber-limbs and a fusion-reactor maintenance hatch was a small, dilapidated structure. It didn't fit the brutalist, industrial aesthetic of the city. It had a curved roof made of salvaged ceramic tiles and a wooden door that looked like it belonged in a museum.

Above the door, a faded holographic projection flickered: **TEMPLE OF THE MERCIFUL OBSERVER**.

"Guanyin?" Bajie whispered, his eyes widening. "Here?"

He pushed open the door. The air inside was cool and smelled faintly of sandalwood—a scent so rare on this planet that it made Bajie’s head spin. In the center of the small room stood a statue. It wasn't the traditional jade figure he knew; it was a construct of polished steel and fiber-optics, depicting a woman with a thousand mechanical arms, each holding a tool of healing or protection.

Bajie knelt before the statue. For the first time since arriving on Kara, he felt a connection to something greater than himself. A faint hum resonated in his chest, a vibration that felt like the distant echo of the Bodhisattva’s power.

"Great Mercy," Bajie prayed, clasping his hands. "If you can hear me... send a sign. Tell me where the Master is."

He closed his eyes and tried to channel his spiritual energy, to send a distress signal through the ether. But just like before, the signal hit a wall of static. The suppression field of the city was too strong.

"Useless," Bajie grunted, standing up. "Even the gods are on mute in this place."

As he turned to leave, a sound stopped him. It was a low, ragged moan coming from the shadows behind the altar.

Bajie moved the heavy velvet curtain aside. Lying on a pile of old prayer mats was a figure he recognized.

It was Alice.

The fox-woman was in bad shape. Her tactical vest was shredded, and a nasty laser burn scorched her left shoulder. Her breathing was shallow, and her amber eyes were glazed with pain.

"Alice?" Bajie knelt beside her. "What happened? Did a security drone get you?"

Alice coughed, a speck of blood appearing on her lips. "Pig... you're here? I thought... I thought I was dead."

"You're not dead yet," Bajie said. He tore a strip of cloth from his own tunic and began to bind her wound. "Who did this to you?"

"My... partner," Alice rasped. "Tiger-Man. Tybalt."

"The heist?"

Alice nodded weakly. "We hit the Omni-Corp vault. It was perfect. We had the credits, the data... everything. But when we got to the extraction point... the security forces were waiting. They knew we were coming."

"A trap?"

"A setup," Alice hissed. "Tybalt... he sold me out. He took the loot and left me to take the fall. I barely made it out... crawled here... thought maybe the Observer would have some mercy."

Bajie felt a surge of anger. He had seen enough betrayal in his life—from the courts of Heaven to the demons of the West. But seeing this fox-woman, who had shown him a sliver of kindness, broken by greed... it ignited a fire in his belly that had nothing to do with hunger.

"He left you to die," Bajie said, his voice low and dangerous.

"He's got the credits," Alice whispered. "He's probably halfway to the Upper City by now. He's going to buy his way into the Council."

"Not if I have anything to say about it," Bajie growled.

He finished bandaging her wound. "Can you move?"

"Barely."

"Good enough." Bajie scooped her up in his arms. She was lighter than the power cells he had been hauling all week. "We can't stay here. If Tybalt knows you're alive, he'll send someone to finish the job."

"Where... where are we going?"

"I made a friend," Bajie said, kicking the temple door open. "A lizard named Kael. He knows the tunnels better than anyone. He'll find us a hole where even a tiger can't sniff us out."

He carried her out into the neon-lit chaos of the market. As he walked, Alice looked up at his face. The pig-man features that usually looked comical or grotesque now seemed set in stone, a mask of grim determination.

"Why?" she asked softly. "I tried to threaten you. I called you a freak."

"You gave me food when I was starving," Bajie said simply. "And you're hurt. That's enough."

Alice rested her head against his chest. For the first time in her life as a thief and a survivor, she felt safe.

"Thank you... Bajie," she whispered.

"Don't thank me yet," Bajie replied, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of a tiger. "We've got a long night ahead of us. And when you're healed... we're going to have a little chat with this Tybalt."
