# Chapter 97: The Anchor of the Sea

The descent was hell.

They were in a specialized bathyscaphe, reinforced with dragon-scale plating and Tianji's force fields, but the pressure alarms were screaming before they even reached the Mantle Zone.

"Hull integrity at 60%," Tianji reported, his fingers blurred on the controls. "External temperature: 3000 decrees. We are entering the Magma Sea."

Outside, the ocean had turned to fire. Liquid rock swirled in cyclonic currents, illuminated by the blinding white light of the unstable core below.

"There's the breach!" Ao Guang shouted, pointing at the viewscreen.

It was a tear in reality. A jagged black crack in the center of the planet, sucking everything into it. Magma, light, even gravity itself was being drawn into the void.

"It's bigger than the simulation," Wukong unbuckled his harness. "The ship can't get close enough. I have to go out."

"You'll be crushed!" Bajie grabbed his arm. "Monkey, don't be stupid! That's a black hole in a bottle!"

"I've been in a furnace before," Wukong winked. "This is just a sauna."

He opened the airlock.

The force hit him instantly. It felt like a mountain was dropped on his chest. His Golden Chain Mail groaned against the pressure. His fur singed. But he didn't stop.

He summoned the Cloud Somersault, converting it into a compression shield around his body. He flew towards the singularity.

"Grow!" he shouted, throwing the Golden Staff forward.

The staff responded. It expanded, growing thicker, longer. Iron bands glowed white-hot.

The singularity pulled at it. The staff vibrated, fighting the gravitational shear.

Wukong grabbed the end of the staff. He felt the weapon's spirit screaming. It didn't want to go in there. It wanted to fight, to fly, to kill.

"I know, old friend," Wukong gritted his teeth, tears evaporating instantly on his face. "I know. But they need an anchor. And you're the only one strong enough."

He channeled all his spiritual energy into the staff. *72 Transformations: Mountain Form.*

He added his own mass to the weapon. He became the hammer.

"SETTLE THE SEA!" Wukong roared.

He drove the staff into the black crack.

The universe seemed to pause.

The staff expanded explosively. It filled the void. It bridged the gap between the tectonic plates. The gold bands locked into the planetary crust.

**BOOM.**

A shockwave of pure stability rippled out. The magma stopped swirling. The gravity normalized. The tear hurried to close, sealing itself around the indestructible iron pillar.

Wukong let go.

The staff was gone. In its place was a massive, golden column connecting the core to the mantle, humming with a low, eternal frequency that resonated through the entire planet.

He floated there, empty-handed. His palm still tingled where the cold iron used to be.

"Goodbye," he whispered into the magma.

The bathyscaphe swooped down and scooped him up just as his personal shield collapsed.

Inside, Bajie hugged him, blubbering. Ao Guang knelt on the deck, weeping.

"It is done," Tianji announced, looking at the sensors. "Core stability: 100%. The planet is saved."

Wukong sat on the floor, staring at his empty hands. He felt lighter. And for the first time in five hundred years, he felt unarmed.
