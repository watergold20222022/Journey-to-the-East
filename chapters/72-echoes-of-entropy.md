# Chapter 72: Echoes of Entropy

The trail to System 81-X was not hard to follow. It was paved with dead ships.

Nezha dropped the *Red Armillary* out of warp forty parsecs from the destination. His sensors had picked up a distress beacon—a standard Heavenly Navy code.

He found the source drifting near a nebula.

It was a *Pagoda*-class Cruiser, the *Silent Sentinel*. It was one of his father’s ships. A heavy enforcement vessel crewed by three thousand immortals.

Now, it was a ghost ship.

Nezha drifted his fighter alongside the massive hull. There were no blast marks. No hull breaches from torpedoes. Instead, the ship looked like it had been dipped in gray paint that had eaten away the color and the life.

"Life signs?" Nezha asked.

"Negative," the AI replied. "Bio-readings are zero. But... structural integrity is 100%."

Nezha frowned. That didn't make sense. If the ship was intact, where was the crew?

He engaged the auto-dock and boarded the cruiser.

The corridors of the *Silent Sentinel* were perfectly preserved. The lights were on. The air recyclers were humming.

But the crew was gone.

Nezha walked onto the bridge. The captain's chair was empty. The navigation consoles were active, displaying a red trajectory line—the same one Nezha was following.

"They didn't fight back," Nezha observed. He touched a console. It was cold, draining the heat from his glove.

He pulled up the ship's log. The last entry was a video file. Time-stamped six hours ago.

*Play.*

The holographic projector whirred. The image of Captain Ju, a veteran of the Northern Campaigns, appeared. He looked pale.

"We intercepted the target," Captain Ju said, his voice trembling. "Identification: Fugitive Red Boy. We ordered him to power down."

The captain paused, looking off-camera.

"He didn't fire at us. He just... looked at us. And then the darkness came. It wasn't vacuum. It was a wave. It passed through the shields like they weren't there. It passed through the hull."

On the recording, the captain held up his hand. It was becoming translucent, turning into gray dust.

"It's taking us," Ju whispered. "Not killing us. Taking us. Absorbing our data. Our consciousness. He's eating the crew to fuel his jump."

The recording dissolved into static.

Nezha punched the console, shattering the screen.

"He consumed them," Nezha snarled. "Three thousand soldiers. Just for fuel."

The sheer disrespect of it infuriated him. In war, you killed your enemy. You didn't *eat* them like a battery. It was a violation of the warrior's code. It was something a demon would do.

"Analysis complete," the AI chimed in. "The residual energy signature matches the void pattern from Kunlun. But it is stronger now. Magnitude increase: 200%."

"He's leveling up," Nezha said.

He looked at his own hands. His body was a masterpiece of bio-engineering, grown from the divine lotus. But could it withstand that? Could he be eaten?

He reached into his sub-space inventory and pulled out the Qiankun Ring. The Golden Universe Ring. It was a heavy hoop of gold, usually worn around his neck or wrist. It hummed with gravitational potential.

"Interface mode," Nezha commanded.

The Ring floated into the air and expanded. It began to spin, generating a localized event horizon field.

"Calibrate to anti-entropy frequency," Nezha ordered. "If he tries to drain me, I want this ring to act as a dam. nothing gets out. Nothing gets in."

"Calibration in progress. Warning: This will reduce offensive output by 30%."

"Do it," Nezha said. "I don't need full power to kill a brat. But I need to survive his pet shadow."

He returned to his fighter, leaving the ghost ship behind. The *Silent Sentinel* would drift forever, a tomb of stolen souls.

"You made a mistake, Red Boy," Nezha whispered as he engaged the engines. "You left a witness."

The *Red Armillary* flared, jumping back into the stream of red starlight. Next stop: Yellow Wind Ridge.
