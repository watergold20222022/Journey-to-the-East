# Chapter 79: The Unexpected Alliance

The cavern was silent except for the ragged breathing of the boy on the floor. Red Boy's skin was pale, mapped with black veins where the Void was eating him from the inside out. The "Soul Cannon" had disrupted his ability to control the entropy.

Nezha landed, retracting his wheels. He looked down at his enemy.

"You look like a broken toy," Nezha said.

Red Boy opened one eye. "You... returned. Did you kill him?"

"No," Nezha admitted, the word tasting like ash. "Deadlock. I can't break the shield without... breaking the batteries."

Red Boy laughed, a wet, coughing sound. "So the War God has a heart. How inconvenient."

"Shut up," Nezha knelt. He placed his hand on Red Boy's chest. "I'm going to reboot your core. Don't bite."

"Get off me!" Red Boy tried to shove him away, but he was too weak.

"Stop moving!" Nezha barked. "Or I'll let you rot here."

He closed his eyes. *Protocol: Lotus Transfer.*

Nezha's body began to glow with a soft, pink light. It wasn't the harsh fire of combat; it was the biological warmth of creation. The energy flowed from his hand into Red Boy's chest, chasing away the black veins, knitting the broken ribs, reigniting the Samadhi Fire.

Red Boy gasped. "This... what is this?"

"Life," Nezha said. "Real life. Not that stolen garbage the fish-man uses."

The process took an hour. When Nezha pulled his hand away, he was sweating, his own face pale. Red Boy sat up, looking at his hands. The fire was back, stable and hot.

"Why?" Red Boy asked, his voice quiet. "I am your enemy. I destroyed your station. I humiliated you."

"You did," Nezha agreed, leaning against the cave wall. "And after we kill this guy, I'm going to beat you senseless for it. But right now... we share a target."

"The King," Red Boy snarled, his eyes darkening.

"He's using a feedback loop," Nezha explained. "I can't touch the shield. But you... your fire doesn't push. It eats."

Red Boy looked at Nezha, understanding dawning on him. "You want me to consume the connection."

"Exactly," Nezha nodded. "I'll draw his fire. I'll invoke the Heavenly Law. It's bright, loud, and distracting. while he's busy trying to kill me, you slip in. Don't attack him. Attack the energy transfer. Eat the cables. Eat the magic. Sever the link."

"And the children?"

"If you do it right, the shield will collapse without backlash," Nezha said. "Then I decapitate him."

Red Boy stood up. The cave temperature rose twenty degrees.

"I don't take orders from Heaven," Red Boy said.

"Fine," Nezha stood up too, summoning his spear. "Then take orders from the guy who just saved your life."

Red Boy stared at him for a long moment. Then, a small, crooked smile appeared.

"One time," Red Boy said. "After this, we go back to war."

"Deal," Nezha extended his hand.

Red Boy looked at it, then grabbed Nezha's forearm in a warrior's grip. His hand was burning hot; Nezha's was cool as jade.

"Twin fires," Nezha said.

"Let's burn him down," Red Boy replied.

They walked to the exit of the tunnel. Two gods, two enemies, walking side by side into the darkness.
