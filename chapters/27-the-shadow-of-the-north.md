The peace of the "holiday" on Planet Kara lasted exactly twelve hours.

Wukong was shaken awake by a frantic pounding on his door. It was General Rakafa, breathless and looking terrified—an expression that sat poorly on a seven-foot Minotaur.

"It's gone," Rakafa stammered. "The relic. The second staff. It's gone."

Ten minutes later, Wukong, Bajie, Alice, and Tianji stood in the deepest sub-basement of the Planetary Defense Headquarters. The Level 10 Vault, designed to hold tactical nuclear warheads, stood open.

The pedestal where they had deposited the "Kara-Timeline" Golden Staff for analysis was empty. A massive hole had been punched through the reinforced dura-steel door—not melted by lasers, but smashed from the outside.

"13,500 catties," Bajie muttered, tracing the jagged edge of the metal. "Nearly eight tons. And someone just walked out with it?"

"Not walked," Tianji corrected. The robot was plugged into the security console, his eyes flashing rapidly. "Ran. At subsonic speeds."

He projected a hologram into the center of the room. The footage was grainy, taken from a backup camera after the main sensors were disabled.

Time: 03:00 AM.
The door exploded inward. A blur of motion—a shadow, darker than the surrounding unlit room—shot to the pedestal. The heavy iron rod was snatched up as if it were a toothpick. In the next frame, the shadow was gone.

"Rewind," Wukong commanded. "Slow it down. Frame by frame."

Tianji complied. The blur slowed, resolving into a hunched, humanoid shape. It was wrapped in tattered cloth, but for a split second, two eyes glowed from the darkness.

Not the red of a cyborg. Not the blue of a Beast-Man.
They were green. Cold, spectral green.

"That speed..." Wukong narrowed his eyes. "That's not technology. That's *Shunpo* (Instant Step). Or something like it."

"No Beast-Man has that kind of muscle density," Rakafa said, shaking his massive head. "Even our strongest power-lifters need an exo-suit to move that rod."

"It's not a Beast-Man," Wukong said grimly. "And it's not a human. To wield that weapon, you need a spirit that resonates with the Divine Iron. Or you need raw, demonic strength."

"A demon?" Alice asked. "Here? I thought the Beast-Men replaced all the supernatural stuff with science."

"The Multiverse is leaking," Bajie said, looking at Wukong. "We brought the staff here. Maybe we brought something else with it. Or maybe this guy has been hiding here all along."

Tianji pulled his interface cable from the wall. "I have tracked the seismic footprints. The target is heavy. Every step he took at that speed created a micro-fracture in the city's foundation."

A map of Planet Kara appeared. A red line snaked from the capital city, heading due North, crossing the temperate zone, and ending in the vast, white expanse of the polar ice cap.

"The Northern Wastes," Rakafa gasped. "That... impossible. The temperature there is absolute zero at night. The atmosphere is liquid nitrogen. Nothing lives there."

"Something does," Wukong stared at the red dot blinking in the heart of the ice. He felt a strange twitch in his chest—not the brotherly connection he felt with Bajie, but something older. A rivalry? A memory?

"He's taking the weapon to the coldest place on the planet," Wukong mused. "Maybe to cool it down? Or maybe..."

"Maybe he wants us to follow," Bajie finished, hefting his rake.

"Alice, warm up the *Sky Rake*," Wukong ordered, heading for the exit. His tail lashed back and forth, a sign of rising excitement. "I was getting bored of the existential crisis anyway. A thief? A fast one? Now that's a problem I can hit."

The existential dread of the empty heavens was forgotten, replaced by the thrill of the hunt. Someone had dared to steal from the Great Sage. And they were going to pay.
