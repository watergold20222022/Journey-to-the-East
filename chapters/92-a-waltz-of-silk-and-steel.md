# Chapter 92: A Waltz of Silk and Steel

The ballroom was open to the stars, though Bajie couldn't be sure if they were real stars or just diamonds embedded in the velvet dome of the ceiling. The music was a slow, melancholic synth-violin melody that seemed to vibrate in his very bones.

"You dance surprisingly well, Marshal," Seven said, her mechanical legs clinking softly against the polished obsidian floor, moving in perfect sync with her human legs.

"I had training," Bajie muttered, holding her waist. He felt clumsy, but she guided him with effortless grace. "Court etiquette. A long time ago."

He looked at her. Her face was a masterpiece of bio-engineering. Flawless skin, eyes that shifted color with the music. But it was the sadness in those eyes that hooked him. She wasn't just a seductress program; she felt... damaged. Like him.

"Why do you stay here?" Bajie asked. "A woman like you... you could be a star in the Core Worlds."

"I cannot leave," Seven whispered. She spun him around. "My sisters and I... we are bound to the Loom. We weave the web that holds the nebula together."

"The Loom?"

"The Great Mother," Seven's voice trembled slightly. "She needs us. She needs our... connection."

She stopped dancing. She led him to the edge of the terrace. Below them, Bajie saw what looked like a city of glowing pods, millions of them, pulsing with a faint, rhythmic light.

"It's beautiful," Bajie said.

"It's a graveyard," Seven corrected him. She turned to him, her mechanical limbs twitching nervously. "Marshal... Zhu. You need to wake up."

Bajie blinked. "What?"

"This isn't real," she said, her voice urgent. She reached up and touched his snout. Her fingers were cold metal. "The music, the ballroom, me. It's a construct. A interface to lower your synaptic resistance."

"I know," Bajie said softly.

Seven froze. "You... you know?"

"I'm a pig, Seven, not an idiot," Bajie smiled sadly. "I know real silk from holographic projections. I know the smell of recycled air. And I know that no beautiful woman looks at me like that unless she wants something."

"Then why?" Seven asked, confused. "Why do you stay?"

"Because for five minutes," Bajie sighed, leaning against the railing, "I didn't have to be the Pig who lost everything. I could pretend I was just... a guy dancing with a pretty girl."

He looked at her mechanical legs. He didn't flinch.

"You're stuck too, aren't you?" Bajie asked.

Seven looked down. "Since I was constructed. I am Unit 7. Designations: Infiltration and Extraction. I gather fuel for the Mother."

"Fuel," Bajie chuckled darkly. "That's me, right?"

"Yes," Seven nodded. A tear—actual saline—rolled down her cheek. "I am supposed to kiss you now. The neuro-toxin is in my lipstick. It paralyzes the motor functions while keeping the brain active. It... tastes like strawberries."

Bajie looked at her lips. Then he looked at her eyes.

"Does it hurt?" he asked.

"The toxin? No. It's euphoric."

"No," Bajie shook his head. "Does it hurt... being a puppet?"

Seven flinched as if he had hit her. "Every day."

"Then let's stop dancing," Bajie said. He reached for his rake, but it wasn't there. He was still in his formal tunic. "Help me get out. And I'll take you with me."

"You can't," Seven stepped back. The music stopped. The stars turned red. "She is listening."

A low rumble shook the floor. The illusion flickered. The ballroom walls dissolved into rusted metal ribs. The starry sky became a pulsing, fleshy membrane.

"She is hungry," Seven gasped. Her eyes turned entirely black. Her mechanical legs snapped into combat position, sharp tips gleaning. "Run, you fool! Wake up!"

"Seven!" Bajie reached for her.

"I'm sorry," she whispered.

She didn't kiss him. She shoved him.

With a strength that shattered his ribs, she pushed him off the terrace.

Bajie fell into the abyss of glowing pods. As he fell, he saw Seven standing on the ledge, screaming silently as thick, black cables erupted from the walls and pierced her spine, dragging her back into the darkness.

"Seven!" Bajie roared.

Then he hit the bottom.
