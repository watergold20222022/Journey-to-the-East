# Chapter 78: The Stalemate

Nezha returned to the factory floor, not as a whisper, but as a thunderclap.

He smashed through the ceiling glass, descending in a pillar of blue flame. The impact cratered the reinforced floor, sending shockwaves that knocked over a dozen automated sentries.

"I'm back!" Nezha announced, twirling his spear. "Did you miss me?"

The King of Inspiration sighed. He was welding a patch onto his throne. "Persistent little fly. Where is the other one? Did he bleed out?"

"He's napping," Nezha said. "I decided didn't need him. He was just slowing me down."

"Arrogance," The King shook his head. "A common flaw in your model."

The King gestured. The defense turrets swiveled. The Innocence Shield flared to life again, the screams of the children becoming a palpable frequency in the air.

Nezha grit his teeth. "Target check: Main reactor. Shield status: Active. Moral constraints: High."

He couldn't blast the shield. The feedback would kill the hostages. He had to be surgical.

"Three Heads, Six Arms: Precision Mode."

Nezha didn't transform into a giant. He compressed his power. Six arms of hard-light manifested, but they held needle-thin lasers instead of massive weapons.

He moved.

He was faster than before. He dodged the turret fire, weaving through the gaps in the defensive grid. He aimed for the physical connectors—the cables and pipes that linked the vats to the shield generator.

*Snip. Snip. Snip.*

He severed three cables in a microsecond.

The shield flickered.

"Effective," The King admitted. "But slow."

The King stood up. His chest furnace roared. "Protocol: Consumption Overdrive."

The remaining cables pulsed. The fluid in the vats began to boil. The children thrashed.

"Stop!" Nezha froze.

"Every cable you cut stresses the remaining ones," The King explained calm, like a teacher scolding a student. "Sever enough, and the surge will fry every brain in this room. Do you want that on your conscience, Hero?"

Nezha hovered in mid-air, his six arms trembling. He was checkmated. He had the power to destroy the room ten times over, but he couldn't use a single ounce of it without collateral damage.

"Coward," Nezha hissed.

"Efficiency," The King corrected. "I use every resource available. Ethics is just wasted energy."

He raised his arm. His hand transformed into a pile driver.

Nezha was forced on the defensive. He blocked the blow with his spear, the impact sending him skidding back across the factory floor.

They fought for an hour. It was a stalemate. Nezha was too fast to be hit, but he couldn't attack. The King was too well-defended, but too slow to catch the Prince.

"We can do this all day," The King grunted, firing a steam-pressurized rivet that Nezha deflected with his ring.

"I have eternity," Nezha lied. His energy reserves were dropping. The fusion core in his chest was whining. He hadn't fully recovered from the dip in the magma ocean.

"You are tiring," The King noted. "My fuel source is renewable. Yours is not."

He pointed to the vats. "Every second we fight, they feed me."

Nezha looked at the children. Their lights were dimming. If he kept this up, he wouldn't save them. He would just watch them fade.

"This isn't working," Nezha realized. "I can't cut the knot. I have to untie it. But I don't have the fingers for it."

He needed something that could bypass the physical connection. Something that could eat the energy without triggering the feedback.

He needed the Void.

Nezha slammed his Gold Brick into the floor, creating a cloud of dust.

"You win this round, fish-face!" Nezha shouted. "But don't get comfortable!"

He activated his thrusters and shot back up heavily toward the ventilation shaft.

"Run, little fly!" The King laughed, sitting back on his throne. "There is nowhere to go. This planet is a cage."

Nezha didn't look back. He flew straight down the shaft, his mind racing. He hated asking for help. It went against every line of code in his ego.

But he hated losing more.

"Wake up, brat," Nezha muttered to himself as he descended into the dark. "We have work to do."
