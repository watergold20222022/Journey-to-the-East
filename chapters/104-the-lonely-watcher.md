# Chapter 104: The Lonely Watcher

Generations passed in the blink of an eye for the immortal, but for the Children of Primus, it was an age of myth.

The first generation learned to speak. They called Tianji "The Sky-Father." He corrected them gently, insisting on "Teacher."

The second generation learned to forge metal from the wreckage of the Kraken's dropped tentacles. They built cities around the base of the divine mountain.

By the tenth generation, the virus had fully integrated. They were no longer apes. They were a civilization. They had art, philosophy, and mathematics. Especially mathematics.

Tianji sat in the central chamber of the *Sky Rake*. He was old now—not physically, for his cultivation prevented aging, but his spirit was weary. He had spent two hundred years teaching them calculus, physics, and multidimensional geometry.

"Teacher," said the High Archon, a tall, fur-skinned scholar named Koda. "The preliminary ring is complete. We have harnessed the geothermal energy of the equator."

"Good," Tianji said, his voice soft. "But it is not enough. You need to build the Dyson Swarm. You need to turn this entire solar system into a processor."

Koda bowed. "It will take a thousand years."

"I know," Tianji stood up. "And I cannot lead you through it. My presence stifles your creativity. You look to me for answers instead of finding them yourselves."

He walked to the cryo-stasis pod he had prepared. It was modified from the ship's medical bay.

"I am going into the Deep Meditation," Tianji announced. "Do not disturb me. Do not open this door. Only when the Great Machine is ready, when the Array can channel the energy of the star itself into a single point... only then, wake me."

"But Teacher," Koda asked, "what is it for? Why must we build this machine?"

Tianji looked at the screen, where the black hole still swirled, dark and hungry.

"To bring my brothers home," Tianji said.

The pod hissed shut. The frost covered the glass.

Outside, the civilization continued to grow. Wars were fought and ended. Empires rose and fell. The legend of the Lonely Watcher became a religion, then a fable, then a historical footnote. 

But the work continued. The Great Machine grew, a spiderweb of metal and light spanning the planet, waiting for the day it would be turned on.

Inside the ice, Tianji dreamed of a monkey and a pig, falling forever into the dark.

"Wait for me," he dreamt. "I'm coming."
