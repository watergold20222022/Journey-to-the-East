The interior of the pyramid was a laboratory of ice and horror. Vats of green bioluminescent fluid lined the walls, each containing a floating, half-formed monstrosity. But Wukong ignored them. His eyes were fixed on the central chamber.

There, floating in a column of anti-gravity energy, was the stolen Golden Staff.

And guarding it stood a figure that stopped Wukong's heart.

He was tall, broad-shouldered, and draped in a cloak made from the pelts of the white snowy owls. His skin was the color of a bruised glacier—a deep, necrotic indigo. His hair was a shock of crimson fire, matted and wild, falling over eyes that burned with a fanatical, green fever-light. Around his neck hung a necklace not of prayer beads, but of shrunken, cybernetic skulls.

In his hand, he held a massive *Yueya Chan*—a Crescent Moon Spade—that crackled with unstable plasma energy.

"Sha Seng?" Wukong whispered, stepping forward. "Little Brother?"

The figure snapped explicitly into focus. The green eyes locked onto Wukong. There was no recognition. No warmth. Only hate.

"DEMON!" the figure roared. His voice sounded like grinding stones. "You dare defile the Sanctuary of the Cold Void?"

"It's me!" Wukong lowered his staff. "It's Wukong! Your Big Brother!"

"The Monkey King is dead!" Sha Wujing screamed. "Lies! All demons speak lies!"

With a roar, he launched himself across the room. The Crescent Moon Spade swung in a deadly arc, aiming for Wukong's neck.

Wukong dodged, but only barely. The blade sliced a few hairs from his ear.

"Sandy, stop!" Wukong yelled, parrying the next strike. *Clang!* The force of the blow drove Wukong's feet into the ice floor.

Sha Seng didn't stop. He fought with the desperation of a madman. He spun the heavy spade like a propeller, creating a shield of plasma that scorched the air. He summoned pillars of ice from the ground to impale Wukong. He spat blinding freezing mist.

Wukong could have ended it in a second. He could have crushed Sha Seng's skull with a single blow of his 13,500-catty iron rod. But he couldn't do it. Every time he saw an opening, he hesitated. That was his brother. That was the quiet, loyal soul who had carried the luggage for fourteen years without complaint.

"Why won't you fight?" Sha Seng howled, kicking Wukong in the chest. "Die, demon! Die!"

Wukong was thrown back, crashing into a vat of green fluid. He wiped slime from his face, his expression pained. "I don't want to hurt you, idiot!"

"He doesn't know you, Monkey!" Bajie shouted, charging into the fray. "Get out of the way!"

Bajie didn't have Wukong's hesitation. He saw a threat to his brother, and he acted.

"Nine-Toothed Rake: Gravity Anchor!" Bajie bellowed.

He slammed his rake into the ground. A shockwave of gravity distortion rippled out, catching Sha Seng mid-leap. The indigo-skinned warrior was slammed into the floor as if a mountain had fallen on him.

"Now!" Bajie yelled to Alice.

Alice fired a net-launcher. A mesh of high-tensile carbon fiber wrapped around Sha Seng, tightening instantly. Electric nodes flared, sending thousands of volts into his body.

Sha Seng convulsed, roaring in heavy, guttural bursts, but he didn't pass out. He thrashed against the gravity and the net, his eyes rolling back in his head, foam frothing at his mouth.

"Unclean! Filth!" Sha Seng screamed, his voice cracking. "You come to steal the Master's relic! I will purge you! I will cleanse this world!"

Wukong walked over, looking down at the thrashing figure. Even bound, Sha Seng was trying to bite them.

"He's insane," Wukong said softly. The pain in his voice was sharper than any blade. "He thinks he's protecting the staff."

"He called it the 'Master's relic'," Tianji noted, scanning the prisoner. "His cognitive functions are severely degraded. I detect traces of the same mutagenic energy found in the beasts outside. Whatever changed the animals... it changed him too."

"Who did this to you?" Wukong knelt, ignoring Sha Seng's snapping teeth. He reached out and touched his brother's forehead. It was freezing cold. "Who turned my loyal brother into a monster?"

Sha Seng stopped struggling for a second. He stared at Wukong, his green eyes dilating.

"The... Bone..." he rasped, before the madness took him again. "THE BONE LADY COMES! SHE COMES FOR THE FLESH!"

He threw his head back and howled, a sound of pure, broken despair.

Wukong stood up. His grip on his staff was so tight the metal groaned.

"Baigujing," Wukong whispered, the name tasting like poison. "The White Bone Demon."

Bajie's face went pale. "But... we killed her. Three times."

"In our world, maybe," Wukong looked at the shivering, broken form of Sha Seng. "But not in this one."
