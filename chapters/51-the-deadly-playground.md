# Chapter 51: The Deadly Playground

The moment they crossed the threshold, the blast doors slammed shut behind them with a finality that shook the floor.

The darkness of the facility was instantly banished by blinding banks of overhead halogen lights flicking on in sequence. They illuminated a hall that stretched for miles, lined with observation windows and control consoles that hummed to life after a millennium of sleep.

"Power grid coming online," Sentry-7 announced, its head swiveling rapidly. "They are detecting us. Or rather... him."

Little Stone was hopping ahead, intrigued by the lights. He poked a console, and it beeped. He giggled and poked it again.

"Critical System Alert," the disembodied voice returned, echoing from everywhere. "Subject Zero: Vital signs optimal. Muscle density: 100%. Psionic containment: Unstable. Initiating Phase 4 Combat Calibration."

"Combat Calibration?" Tang Seng’s eyes widened. "Little Stone! Come back!"

He lunged for the monkey, but a wall of shimmering blue energy slammed down from the ceiling, cutting them off. Tang Seng bounced off the force field, sliding to the floor.

"Master!" Ao Lie struck the barrier with his sword, but the blade simply sparked and rebounded. "It is a hard-light construct. Impenetrable."

On the other side of the barrier, Little Stone looked back, confused. He tapped the blue wall with his nano-staff. *Buzz.*

"Test sequence commencing in 3... 2... 1..."

The floor beneath Little Stone shifted. Panels retracted, revealing deep pits filled with spikes. From the walls, turrets emerged, their barrels tracking the small, confused monkey.

"Run!" Tang Seng screamed, pounding on the glass-like shield.

*ZAP.*

A laser bolt the size of a spear shot from the wall, aimed directly at Little Stone's head.

The monkey didn't scream. He didn't cower. At the last possible millisecond, he sneezed and ducked. The laser singed the tip of his ear fur and blasted a crater into the floor.

Little Stone blinked, looking at the smoking hole. Then he looked at the turret. A grin spread across his face.

"Shiny!" he chirped.

Three more turrets fired. Little Stone pushed off the ground with his boots, launching himself into the air in a perfect backflip. He landed on one of the moving floor panels, bounced off it, and grabbed a hanging cable, swinging over the spike pit.

To Tang Seng, it was a horror show. To Little Stone, it was the best jungle gym ever.

"Wheee!" Little Stone squealed as a gravity-crusher plate slammed down inches behind his tail. He scrambled up the side of the crusher, using it as an elevator to reach higher ground.

The AI seemed frustrated. "Subject evasion rate: 99%. Increasing difficulty. Deploying Hunter Drones."

Swarms of spherical drones buzzed out of the ceiling vents, their blades spinning. They chased Little Stone through the obstacle course.

The monkey treated them like slow-moving bees. He vaulted over one, used another as a stepping stone, and smacked a third with his nano-staff—not to destroy it, but to play fetch.

"He... he is playing," Ao Lie whispered, lowering his sword. "He does not know they are trying to kill him."

"His reflexes are pre-cognitive," Sentry-7 analyzed, its blue eye tracking the blur of motion. "He moves before the targeting computers can lock on. It is raw instinct. The 'Project Wukong' scientists... they succeeded in creating the perfect vessel."

Inside the arena, Little Stone was having the time of his life. He hung by his tail from a laser emitter, swinging back and forth to dodge enemy fire. He caught a missile—a literal explosive missile—mid-air, looked at it curiously, and then threw it back at a drone because it was "hot."

*BOOM.*

The explosion rattled the facility. Little Stone clapped his hands, delighted by the fireworks.

"Subject lethality potential: Infinite," the AI droned, sounding almost impressed. "Calibration complete. Proceeding to Neural Integration."

The chaotic barrage of lasers and drones suddenly stopped. The room fell silent, save for the crackle of fires from destroyed robots.

Little Stone landed in the center of the room, breathing hard but smiling. He looked at the force field where Tang Seng was standing.

"Master!" Little Stone called out, waving his staff. "Fun! play!"

Tang Seng slumped against the barrier, his legs weak with relief. "No... no more play. Sentry, get us in there. We have to get him out before the 'Integration' starts."

"I am attempting to bypass the firewall," Sentry-7 said, interfacing with a nearby port. "But Guest... look at him. He is not afraid. He belongs here in a way we do not."

Tang Seng looked at the innocent, devastatingly powerful child standing amidst the wreckage of high-tech weaponry.

"That is what scares me," Tang Seng whispered. "This project was made to build a weapon. And I fear they built a very good one."
