# Chapter 82: The Golems of Scrap

The scavenger raid happened on the third night.

A fleet of Rust-Raiders—cyborg pirates who preyed on dead worlds—landed on the southern continent. They thought Planet Lament was abandoned. They thought they could strip the factories for copper and maybe find some leftover "spare parts" in the vats.

They were wrong.

Nezha intercepted them alone. He didn't kill them. He dismantled their ships with surgical precision, stripping the engines, the weapons, and the plating, leaving the pirates stranded in the smog.

"We need more eyes," Nezha said, dragging a massive pile of salvage back to the main factory. "I can't patrol the whole planet 24/7. And you need to sleep to keep that Void corruption in check."

Red Boy was sitting cross-legged by a blast furnace, meditating. "So? We build a wall?"

"Better," Nezha dumped the scrap metal on the floor. "We build an army."

For the next three days, the factory sounded like a war zone. But it was the sound of creation.

Nezha, the Lotus Prince who was himself a construct of divine vegetation and magic, understood the anatomy of the artificial better than anyone. He used his Fire-tipped Spear to weld, his Universe Ring to bend titanium like clay.

He took the chassis of the destroyed automated turrets. He took the legs of the heavy lifters. He took the sensors from the King's throne.

He built them: **The Iron Guardians.**

They were twelve feet tall, humanoid but crude. Their armor was mismatched, a patchwork of rust and clean steel. They had no faces, just a single, glowing sensor eye.

"They are shells," Red Boy observed, walking through the rows of silent machines. "Empty. They have no power source. The factory batteries are dead."

"That's where you come in," Nezha pointed to the chest of the lead Golem. It had an open cavity, lined with conductive crystal.

"Me?"

"Your fire," Nezha explained. "The Samadhi Fire. It burns without fuel. It is self-sustaining. If you put a spark in there, it will run forever."

"My fire destroys," Red Boy frowned. "It doesn't power."

"It's about intent," Nezha said. "Don't think about burning. Think about... breathing. Think about a heartbeat."

Red Boy hesitated. He placed his hand into the Golem's chest cavity. He closed his eyes. He thought about the anger that had driven him for centuries. The desire to consume.

*No.*

He thought about the silence of the cave. The feeling of Nezha's hand healing him. He thought about the fear in the eyes of the beast-man girl.

*Protect.*

A small, quiet flame ignited in his palm. It wasn't the black fire of the Void. It was a pure, golden-red flame. The True Samadhi Fire.

He pushed it into the crystal.

The Golem shuddered. The flame caught hold of the crystal lattice. The machine's single eye flickered on, glowing a warm, steady orange.

"System Online," the Golem spoke. Its voice was deep, resonant, like a temple bell. "Awaiting command."

"It works," Nezha grinned. "One down. Five thousand to go."

They worked in shifts. Nezha built the bodies; Red Boy ignited the souls.

By the end of the week, the factory was guarded by a legion of Scrap Golems. They didn't march with military precision. They lumbered, clanking and whirring. But they were gentle.

Nezha watched as a Golem carefully lifted a group of children across a broken catwalk, its massive metal hands cradling them like eggs.

"They are ugly," Red Boy commented, standing on the roof.

"They are beautiful," Nezha corrected. "They are the first things on this planet that weren't built to hurt."

He looked at Red Boy. "And you made them alive."

Red Boy looked at his hands, still warm from the creation. For the first time, the fire didn't feel heavy. It felt... light.
