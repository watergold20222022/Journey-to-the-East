# Chapter 41: The Dragon's Tears

The journey to the Mother Tree had taken them out of the dense canopy and into a region of sparkling, crystal-clear wetlands. Mirror-like pools dotted the landscape, reflecting the violet sky and the floating islands above.

Tang Seng sat on a large, flat rock by the edge of a particularly deep lake, gratefully accepting a synthesized nutrient bar from Sentry-7.

"Hydration levels are optimal," the robot reported, standing guard with its back to the water. "However, your cardiac rhythm suggests elevated emotional stress. Are you fatigued, Guest?"

"No, Sentry," Tang Seng said, gazing out at the water. "Just... hopeful. I feel something here. A resonance."

It wasn't the overwhelming bio-noise of the planet. It was a specific, piercing clarity. A note in the symphony that he recognized from a lifetime ago. From another world.

Suddenly, the surface of the lake began to boil.

Sentry-7 spun around, its arm transforming into a pulse cannon. "Warning: Large aquatic displacement detected. Threat level: Calculating."

"Wait!" Tang Seng stood up, his heart leaping into his throat. "Don't shoot!"

A column of water exploded upward, towering high into the air. From the cascading spray, a creature of breathtaking majesty emerged. It was a dragon—long and serpentine, with scales of pure, iridescent white silver that outshone the strange sun of this world. Its antlers were like branching coral, and its whiskers floated on the wind like silk ribbons.

It roared, but the sound wasn't aggressive. It was a cry of mournful joy that shook the very air.

"Ao Lie!" Tang Seng cried out, tears springing to his eyes.

The dragon spiraled down, its massive body shrinking, light condensing around it. Before it hit the ground, the form shifted. The scales retracted into white robes, the claws softened into hands.

A young man with noble features and a silver crown landed softly on the grass. He stumbled forward, falling to his knees before Tang Seng.

"Master!"

"Ao Lie!" Tang Seng rushed forward, pulling the young man into an embrace. It was the White Dragon Horse—the third prince of the West Sea, his steed, his silent protector.

"Master!" Ao Lie wept, his shoulders shaking. "I thought I had lost you forever. I woke up in the deep water... alone. I searched the currents, I called out to the fish, but no one answered. I thought the Void had taken us all."

"I am here, my child. I am here," Tang Seng soothed him, patting his back. "We are alive."

Sentry-7 lowered its weapon, its optic aperture adjusting. "Analysis: Shapeshifting biological entity. DNA markers consistent with... unknown mythology. Guest, is this the 'White Dragon Horse' from your database queries?"

Ao Lie pulled back, wiping his eyes. He looked at the white ceramic robot with sharp, intelligent eyes. "Master, what is this... golem?"

"This is Sentry-7," Tang Seng introduced, smiling through his own tears. "He is a friend. He has guided me through this strange world. Sentry, this is Ao Lie. He carried me across ten thousand miles on our journey."

"Greetings," Sentry-7 said, bowing slightly. "Your ability to manipulate mass and form violates several laws of physics known to my creators. It is... fascinating."

Ao Lie stood up, regaining his princely composure, though his eyes remained red. He walked up to the robot and tapped the ceramic armor. "Metal and lightning. No soul, yet I sense loyalty. You have done well to protect my Master, construct."

"I am merely fulfilling my optimized directives," Sentry-7 replied.

"Ao Lie," Tang Seng asked, "do you know where Wukong and the others are?"

The dragon prince shook his head sadly. "No, Master. When the sky tore open, I was thrown into a vortex of water. I woke up at the bottom of this lake days ago. I have been sensing the currents, trying to find a trace of Eldest Brother's chaotic energy, but this planet... it is too loud. The life force here drowns out everything."

"We are going to the Mother Tree," Tang Seng explained. "Sentry says it is the mind of this planet. If anyone knows where they are, it is the Tree."

Ao Lie nodded firmly. "Then I will take you there."

He looked ready to transform back into his dragon form, but he paused, looking at the dense, floating terrain ahead.

"Flying is difficult here," Ao Lie admitted. "The gravity of the floating islands disrupts my flight magic. But on the ground, I can fight. I have my sword." A gleam of silver light materialized in his hand, forming a sleek, dual-edged blade.

"We have a guide, a guardian, and now a warrior," Tang Seng said, feeling a surge of confidence he hadn't felt since waking up in the moss. "Truly, the Bodhisattvas have not abandoned us."

The three of them stood by the lakeside—a monk in a nanosuit, a robot from a lost human age, and a dragon prince from mythology. It was a strange fellowship, but as Tang Seng looked at them, he knew they could face whatever this beautiful, silent paradise threw at them.

"Let us go," Tang Seng said, pointing West. "The Mother Tree awaits."
