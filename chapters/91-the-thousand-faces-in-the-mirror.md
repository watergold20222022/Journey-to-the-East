# Chapter 91: The Thousand Faces in the Mirror

Wukong opened his eyes.

He was sitting on a stone bench. The air was warm and smelled of peaches. A waterfall roared in the distance, a curtain of white foam crashing down from the mountains.

"Water Curtain Cave?" he whispered.

He looked down at his hands. No golden fur. No claws. Just smooth, human skin. He was wearing a simple linen robe.

"Great Sage!" a voice called out.

He turned. A small monkey, no bigger than a toddler, ran up to him, holding a large peach. But as the monkey got closer, its face shifted. It wasn't a monkey. It was a human child.

"Great Sage, the Master is calling for you," the child said.

"Master?" Wukong blinked. The scenery rippled like water disturbed by a stone. The waterfall turned into a wall of flowing data code for a split second before solidifying back into water.

"Yes. Master Tang is waiting in the library."

Wukong stood up. He knew this was wrong. He remembered the nebula. He remembered the ship. But the memory felt thin, like a dream he was waking up from. This... this felt real. The sun on his face. The smell of the fruit.

He walked into the cave. It wasn't a cave inside; it was a high-tech archive, endless rows of crystal servers humming with blue light.

In the center sat a monk. He wore the Golden Kasaya, but it was woven from fiber-optics.

"Wukong," the monk smiled. It was Tripitaka. But not the one who died. And not the one in the diary. This one looked... whole. "You're late for your lesson."

"Lesson?" Wukong asked. "I don't need lessons. I need to find you."

"You have found me," the monk said gently. "I never left. The journey is over, Wukong. You succeeded. Don't you remember?"

"I... succeeded?"

"Yes. You brought the Sutras back. You saved the world from the Great Silence. Now, we rest. We catalog the universe."

Wukong felt a wave of peace wash over him. No more fighting. No more demons. No more cold, dead planets. Just this. Eternal peace.

"It's a lie," a voice hissed in his ear.

Wukong spun around. There was no one there.

"Look closer, Stone Monkey. The fruit is rotten."

Wukong looked at the peach on the table. It was perfect, pink and ripe. But as he stared, he saw beneath the skin. Maggots writhed inside. And the maggots were made of metal.

Meanwhile, in another sector of the simulation...

Tianji stood in a white room. It was infinite.

"Calculation complete," the voice of the Universe said.

In front of him floated the Equation. The Grand Unification Theory. The solution to entropy.

"It balances," Tianji whispered, his logic circuits firing in ecstasy. "It finally balances. Chaos is solvable."

He reached out to touch the equation. If he could upload this, he could fix everything. He could stop stars from dying. He could cure the Beast-Men. He could rewrite the laws of physics to eliminate suffering.

"Input variable," the Universe requested. "Please provide root access to your core processor."

"Granted," Tianji said without hesitation. "Take everything. Just give me the answer."

A cable descended from the white void, snake-like, seeking the port on his neck.

And in a garden of red flowers...

Zhu Bajie woke up on a bed of silk. He sat up, groggy.

"Where... where's the ship?"

"Hush, handsome," a soft voice cooed.

He looked up. Standing before him was a vision. She was tall, with skin like porcelain and eyes like dark stars. She wore a dress of shimmering red silk that seemed to move on its own.

"Who are you?" Bajie asked, mesmerized.

"I am the Seventh Sister," she curtsied. "But you can call me Seven. We've been waiting for you, Marshal."

"Marshal?" Bajie straightened his tunic. "You know who I am?"

"Of course," she sat beside him, her hand brushing his arm. Her touch was cool, metallic, but electrifying. "The Commander of the Heavenly River. The hero who fell from grace for love. We love tragic heroes here."

Bajie felt his heart skip a beat. She didn't see a pig. She saw the man he used to be. Or maybe... the man he wanted to be.

"I... I think I'm lost," Bajie stammered.

"No," Seven smiled, and for a moment, Bajie thought he saw something click behind her eyes, like a camera shutter. "You're home."

She leaned in. Bajie closed his eyes.

He didn't see the six mechanical legs unfolding from her back, sharp as scalpels, poised to embrace him.
