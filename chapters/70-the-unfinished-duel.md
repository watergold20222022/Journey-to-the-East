# Chapter 70: The Unfinished Duel

The starfighter *Red Armillary* cut through the sub-space manifold like a needle through silk. It was a masterpiece of Heavenly engineering, a interceptor built for a single pilot, powered by a contained singularity that hummed with the same frequency as the Wind Fire Wheels.

Inside the cockpit, Nezha floated in a suspension of gel-light, his neural interface synchronized with the ship's navigation systems.

"ETA to Kunlun Sector: 3 hours," the AI announced.

Nezha closed his eyes. Three hours. Too long.

"Pull up the archives," he commanded, his voice echoing in the silence of his mind. "File ID: Great Sage."

Data streams flooded his vision. Images, sensor logs, damage reports from five hundred years ago. And then, the memory files.

*Simulation playback: Initiating.*

The silence of the ship vanished, replaced by the deafening roar of the Celestial War.

Nezha was back there. The South Heavenly Gate, burning. The sky was filled with the debris of shattered cruisers and falling seraphims. And in the center of the chaos, laughing, was *him*.

Sun Wukong.

The Monkey King wore his Phoenix-feather Cap and his Golden Chain Mail, but it was the look in his eyes that Nezha remembered most. It wasn't malice. It was joy. Pure, unadulterated chaos.

"Come on, Third Prince!" The memory-Wukong shouted, spinning the Golden Cudgel destroyers-worth of dense alloy like a baton. "Show me what the toys of Heaven can do!"

In the simulation, Nezha activated his Three Heads, Six Arms protocol. His combat frame expanded, extra limbs manifesting from hard-light constructs, each wielding a weapon: the Yin-Yang Swords, the Gold Brick, the Fire-tipped Spear.

They clashed.

The impact shook the sensors of the recording. The heat of their collision vaporized the cloud-cities around them. Nezha remembered the weight of the Cudgel against his spear—impacts that rattled his very bones, shocks that overloaded his dampeners.

He was faster. Wukong was stronger.
He was precision. Wukong was unpredictability.

They fought for three thousand rounds. A stalemate that leveled a mountain range.

And then, the trick. Wukong had plucked a hair, turned it into a duplicate, and while Nezha severed the clone's head, the real Monkey had flanked him, landing a blow that cracked Nezha's primary reactor casing.

The memory ended abruptly.

Nezha opened his eyes in the cockpit. His pulse was elevated. The shame of that day still burned, hot and fresh, five centuries later. He had wanted a rematch. He had trained, upgraded, optimized his body and his weapons for the sole purpose of defeating the Monkey Kingfair and square.

But Wukong had been captured by the Buddha. Imprisoned under the Five Elements Mountain. And now...

"Rebooted," Nezha muttered.

The Wukong that was out there now wasn't the Great Sage who had nearly dismantled Heaven. He was a glitched copy. A level-one character in a high-level zone.

"Defeating him now would prove nothing," Nezha said to the darkness of space. "It would be like kicking a puppy."

But this Red Boy...

The files on the Holy Infant were sparse. A localized threat. High thermal output. But Guanyin had said he possessed *Void capabilities*. That he had broken the Eternal Hell.

Nezha summoned the profile of Red Boy. The image was grainy—a child with fire in his eyes.

"You beat him," Nezha whispered to the holographic boy. "You did what I couldn't do. You took down the Monkey King."

A smile touched his lips. It wasn't a nice smile.

"That makes you the new benchmark."

If he defeated Red Boy, he would prove that he was superior to Wukong by the transitive property of warfare. It was the only way to close the loop. To finish the duel.

"Computer," Nezha barked. "Reroute power to engines. Override safety limits."

"Warning: Engine core temperature will exceed critical levels," the AI protested.

"I said override it!" Nezha’s eyes flared. "Get me to Kunlun. Now."

The *Red Armillary* shuddered as the singularity flared. The starfighter surged forward, streaking toward the coordinates of the broken Celestial Archive, leaving a trail of red starlight burned into the fabric of the void.
