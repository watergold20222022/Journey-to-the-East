# Chapter 96: The Shattered Heart

Ao Guang led them into the War Room. A massive holographic globe of Planet Ao floated in the center. It was red, pulsing with anger.

"We did this," Ao Guang admitted, staring at the hologram. "Greed. Pure and simple."

He tapped a key. Images of massive drills boring into the ocean floor appeared.

"We needed energy to fuel our fleets. To expand our trade routes. So we tapped into the Dragon Vein—the planetary core. We thought it was inexhaustible."

"Until it wasn't," Tianji commented, reading the seismic data. "You destabilized the magnetic field. The core is fracturing. The planet isn't just shaking; it's unzipping."

"Correction," a resonant, female voice filled the room. "It is bleeding."

The water in the room swirled. From a pool in the corner, a figure emerged. She was enormous, her lower body a serpent's tail, her upper body comprised of shifting, translucent hydro-energy. Her eyes were older than the ocean.

"The Dragon Mother," Ao Guang knelt instantly.

Wukong didn't kneel, but he bowed respectfully. "Old Mother. It's been a while."

"Sun Wukong," the Dragon Mother's voice was like whale song, deep and mournful. "You look... smaller than I remember. But sharper."

She glided towards the hologram.

"The core is not just energy. It is the anchor of our reality. When we pierced it, we created a singularity. It is consuming the planet from the inside out. We tried to plug it with neutronium, with force fields, with magic. Nothing holds."

"Nothing is dense enough," Tianji analyzed. "The gravitational pressure at the singularity point is infinite. Anything you put in there gets crushed into sub-atomic paste."

"Not everything," Dragon Mother turned her gaze to Wukong. Or rather, to his ear.

Wukong instinctively covered his ear. "Hey now. Don't look at me like that."

"The ruyi Jingu Bang," Dragon Mother said. "The Golden Staff. Forged by the Great Yu to measure the depths of the Milky Way. Iron so dense it warps space-time. Flexible enough to change size, but indestructible."

"It is the only thing in the universe that can bridge the gap," Dragon Mother said. "We need a pillar, Wukong. A needle to stitch the wound in the world."

"You want my stick?" Wukong stepped back. "My weapon? The thing that's saved my life ten thousand times?"

"We are asking for a miracle," Ao Guang said, his voice breaking. "If you do not help... five billion lives will perish before the next tide."

"Wukong," Bajie whispered. "Don't do it. Without the staff... you're just a monkey who knows kung fu. You'll get killed out there."

Wukong looked at Bajie. He looked at the trembling hands of the Dragon King. He looked at the data showing the countdown: 42 hours to planetary collapse.

He remembered the underwater city he just walked through. The dragon children playing in the bubble-parks. The families huddling in shelters.

He pulled the needle from his ear. It grew into the gold-banded iron staff. He spun it, the hum familiar and comforting.

"I stole this from you, didn't I?" Wukong grinned at Ao Guang. "Back in the day?"

"You... borrowed it," Ao Guang managed a weak smile. "Permanent loan."

"Loans come due," Wukong sighed. He slammed the staff onto the floor. The metal rang out, a clear, defiant note.

"Tianji, calculate the insertion vector," Wukong commanded. "If I'm going to lose my best friend, I want to make sure it counts."
