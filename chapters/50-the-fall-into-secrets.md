# Chapter 50: The Fall into Secrets

Little Stone did not walk. He bounced.

The journey back toward the Mother Tree had turned into a game of "keep up with the monkey." He would sprint ahead, climb a fern, hang by his tail, and wait for the rest of the group to catch up, only to screech and dash off again.

"He has... significant aerobic capacity," Sentry-7 noted, its servos whirring as it navigated a root system that Little Stone had cleared in a single leap.

"He is a child," Tang Seng said, watching the small figure in the tiger-pattern vest darting through the bioluminescent undergrowth. "Let him play. The world is new to him."

Little Stone had spotted something interesting. A butterfly, its wings made of spinning gears and stained glass, was fluttering near a rocky outcrop. He chattered excitedly and gave chase, his new boots gripping the mossy ground.

The butterfly landed on a patch of ground that looked perfectly normal—a flat expanse of green moss between two boulders. Little Stone didn't hesitate. He leaped, hands outstretched to catch the prize.

*CLICK.*

The sound was mechanical, loud, and totally out of place in the organic jungle.

The "solid" ground beneath Little Stone's feet split open like an iris shutter. There was no time to scream. The monkey, the butterfly, and a cloud of dust vanished instantly into the earth.

"Little Stone!" Tang Seng shouted, running forward.

Ao Lie was faster. The Dragon Prince threw himself at the hole, but the iris mechanism was already snapping shut. He jammed his silver sword into the closing gap. *CRUNCH.* The metal blades of the trap bit into the divine steel, sparking violently, but the sword held the aperture open just enough.

"Master! It is a shaft!" Ao Lie yelled, peering into the darkness. "Deep. Very deep."

"Sentry!" Tang Seng cried.

The robot was already there. It clamped its powerful hands onto the edges of the metal iris and engaged its hydraulic pistons. "Overriding locking mechanism. Maximum output."

With a groan of stressing metal, Sentry-7 forced the trapdoor open.

Below them was not a natural sinkhole. It was a vertical shaft of smooth, dark metal, plunging down into an abyss that swallowed the light.

"He fell," Tang Seng gasped, looking down. "Is he...?"

"Detecting bio-signal," Sentry reported, its blue eye projecting a scanning beam. "Distance: 400 meters below. Status: Alive. Moving erratically."

"He survived a four hundred meter drop?" Ao Lie asked in disbelief.

"He is stone," Tang Seng reminded him, swinging his legs over the edge. "We must go to him."

"I will deploy mag-lines," Sentry said. Ropes of magnetic cable shot from the robot's wrists, anchoring into the surrounding rock. "Descent initiated."

The trip down was eerie. The air grew cold and smelled of stale ozone and ancient lubricants. This was not the vibrant, living planet they knew. This was a tomb of technology.

When their feet finally touched the floor, emergency lights flickered on—dim, red strips that ran along the corridor, casting long, bloody shadows.

Little Stone was sitting on top of a crushed metal crate, looking unhurt but confused. He was holding the mechanical butterfly, which he had apparently caught during the fall. He looked up as Tang Seng landed.

"Master!" Little Stone chirped, holding up the insect. "Look! Shiny bug!"

Tang Seng rushed over and checked the monkey for injuries. Not a scratch. The stone skin was tougher than steel. "You foolish child! You could have been killed!"

Little Stone just giggled and tucked the butterfly into his vest.

Sentry-7 was not looking at the monkey. The robot was staring at the massive blast doors that stood at the end of the corridor. The doors were sealed, dust caked in the crevices, but the lettering stenciled on the surface was still legible under the grime.

It was Earth script. English and Chinese.

**PROJECT WUKONG - RESTRICTED AREA**
**SECURITY LEVEL: OMEGA**
**AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**

"Project... Wukong?" Tang Seng read the words, a chill running down his spine that had nothing to do with the cold air. "Sentry, what is this place? You said the colonists left because they were bored. This... this does not look boring."

Sentry-7 stood motionless. Its optic aperture dilated and contracted rapidly. "Processing... Accessing colonial database... Error. File not found. Cross-referencing geographic sector... Error. This facility does not exist."

"It is standing right in front of us," Ao Lie said, walking up to the door and wiping away more dust. "And it bears the name of my Eldest Brother."

"This is a Black Site," Sentry-7 concluded, its voice dropping an octave. "A facility erased from official records. The encryption on this door is military-grade, dated to the final year of the colony."

Tang Seng looked at Little Stone, who was now poking the blast door with his nano-staff. *Clang. Clang.*

"Why would humans from a thousand years ago have a project named after the Monkey King?" Tang Seng whispered. "Did they know of him? Or did they..."

He looked at the amnesiac stone monkey.

"Or did they try to make him?"

*KAAAA-CHUNK.*

The sound of heavy latches unlocking echoed through the corridor. Little Stone jumped back. Sentry-7 raised its arm cannon. Ao Lie leveled his sword.

The blast doors groaned and began to slide open, revealing a rush of stale, pressurized air and a darkness that felt heavier than the grave.

"Alert," a disembodied, glitching voice announced from the ceiling speakers. "Subject Zero detected. Welcome home."

Little Stone tilted his head. "Home?"

Tang Seng stepped forward, his heart pounding. "We are not going back up, are we?"

"No," Ao Lie said grimly, looking at the smooth metal walls of the shaft they had come down. "The trapdoor above has sealed. The only way is forward."

Together, they stepped across the threshold, into the belly of the secret that humanity had left behind.
