# Chapter 107: Hunters and Prey

The stealth corvette *Silent Night* moved through the slipstream like a scalpel cutting through flesh. It carried no markings, but its signature was unmistakable to those who knew where to look: The Apotheosis Group.

Inside the command deck, Team Icarus prepared for the hunt.

"Time to target horizon: 4 hours," announced Kain. He was the team leader, a man who had replaced so much of his body with cybernetics that his heartbeat was a digital metronome.

"I'm getting interference," muttered Siren. She sat in the sensory chair, cables trailing from her skull into the ship's mainframe. She was the team's 'bloodhound,' genetically modified to taste psionic energy. "Something is blocking the path. It’s bright. Too bright."

"Is it the Monkey?" asked Bulwark, a massive brute of a man fused permanently into a three-meter-tall siege armor. He tested the servos of his Fusion Hammer, a weapon designed to crack orbital habitats.

"No," Siren frowned, her eyes rapid-moving under her eyelids. "The frequency is different. It’s not chaotic like the Monkey. It’s... sharp. Angry. Like a raw nerve exposed to space."

Kain brought up the visual feed. on the main massive holographic screen, the starfield zoomed in.

Floating in the absolute zero of the void, light-years from the nearest atmosphere, sat a boy.

He looked no older than twelve, dressed in archaic armor that seemed to be made of red lotus petals woven with gold. He was sitting cross-legged, mediating. Under his feet, two wheels of burning plasma spun lazily, defying the vacuum's lack of oxygen.

"A biological entity surviving in deep space without a suit?" Bulwark scoffed. "Must be another one of Pangu's reject experiments."

"He's blocking our trajectory," Kain said coldly. "Capture protocol authorized. Let's see if this specimen is worth dissecting."

The *Silent Night* decloaked. Weapon ports opened. A Stasis Net—a web of hard-light lasers designed to paralyze nerve endings—fired toward the boy.

The boy didn't move. But the wheels beneath his feet flared.

"Contact in 3... 2..." Kain counted down.

Suddenly, Siren screamed. She ripped the cables from her head, clutching her bleeding ears.

"Get out!" she shrieked. "Get out of my head!"

Through the ship's speakers, a voice resonated. It didn't come from the comms system; it vibrated through the hull itself.

"I smell the stench of artificial divinity," the voice was young, arrogant, and cold as ice. "Who gave you permission to hunt in my garden?"

The Stasis Net hit the boy and simply evaporated. The boy stood up, grabbing a spear that materialized from thin air.

"Siren, what did you see?" Kain demanded, realizing the threat level had just just spiked to critical.

"They... they want the Monkey," Siren gasped, trembling. "They want to cage the Great Sage."

The boy on the screen smirked. It was a terrifying expression.

"You want to capture Wukong?" The boy laughed, and the sound created a shockwave that rattled the ship's shields. "Even *I* haven't managed to kill him yet. And you think you can put him in a jar?"

The Fire-tipped Spear pointed directly at the bridge.

"Strike one," Nezha said.
