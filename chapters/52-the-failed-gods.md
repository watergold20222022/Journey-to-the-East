# Chapter 52: The Failed Gods

"Firewall breach successful," Sentry-7 announced, its fingers retracted from the data port. The blue force field separating them from the arena flickered and died.

But the door out of the testing chamber led deeper into the facility, not back to the surface. Little Stone was already bouncing through it, the AI guiding him toward "Processing."

"We have to catch him," Tang Seng said, stepping over the wreckage of a drone.

They ran down a service corridor that smelled of formaldehyde and decay. As they rounded a corner, the sleek, sterile aesthetic of the testing arena gave way to something far more horrific.

They had entered the storage wing.

Floor-to-ceiling glass tanks lined the walls, stretching into the darkness. Most were broken, their fluids long evaporated, leaving behind dusty, skeletal remains. But some were still sealed, the preservation gel murky and green.

Tang Seng stopped in front of one, his hand covering his mouth in revulsion.

Floating inside was a creature that looked like a macaque, but it had six ears on each side of its head. Its eyes were sewn shut with metal staples, and its chest was cut open, revealing a mechanical heart.

"Six Ears..." Ao Lie whispered, his face draining of color. "This... this is a mockery of the Six-Eared Macaque."

They moved to the next tank. A gibbon with arms that reached its feet, but the arms were made of hydraulic pistons.
The next: A baboon with a brain exposed under a glass dome, wired into a combat simulation unit.

"These are not natural," Ao Lie said, gripping his sword. "They are monsters. Failed attempts."

center "Project logs accessed," Sentry-7 reported, pausing by a terminal that was still flickering with data. "Decrypting file: 'Genesis Protocol'."

The robot projected a hologram into the air. It showed a group of scientists in lab coats, arguing over a star chart.

*"The signal from Sector ZZ-9 is clear,"* a lead scientist said in the recording. *"It's not just background radiation. It's a narrative. A history. We are decoding a biological blueprint from a parallel reality."*

*"You want to clone a god?"* another asked skeptically.

*"We want to clone a weapon,"* the lead scientist corrected. *"The data describes an entity of infinite adaptability. The 'Monkey King'. If we can synthesize this genome, we won't need fleets or nukes. We will have a one-man army."*

The recording shifted to a montage of failures. Genetic deviations. Mental collapses. Subjects tearing themselves apart in rage.

*"We can copy the body,"* the scientist's voice narrating was now tired, desperate. *"We can weave the carbon-fiber muscles and the silicon bones. But the mind... the Qi... it rejects the vessel. They all go mad. They lack the Soul Spark."*

The hologram fizzled out.

"They heard the story of the Journey to the West," Tang Seng realized, looking at the rows of dead monstrosities. "Across the stars. Across time. And they thought they could steal the hero from the story."

"But they failed," Sentry-7 said. "Until today. The Pearl from the Dragon Prince... it provided the one thing science could not synthesize: The Soul."

Tang Seng looked down the corridor where Little Stone had disappeared.

"They did not create him," Tang Seng said firmly. "They only built the shell. The soul... that belongs to Wukong. And they will not have it."

"Warning," Sentry-7 interrupted, its sensors flashing red. "Little Stone has entered the Neural Integration Chamber. The system is preparing to overwrite his consciousness with the combat tactical matrix."

"Overwrite?" Ao Lie's eyes blazed. "They want to erase him?"

"He is hardware to them," Sentry said, its voice cold. "Empty hard drive. Ready for formatting."

"Run!" Tang Seng shouted, picking up his pace. "We save him now!"

They sprinted past the silent gallery of failed gods, leaving the ghosts of the scientists and their twisted creations behind. The only thing that mattered now was saving the one success from the fate he was built for.
