# Chapter 7: The Fox and the Market

Hunger was a familiar enemy to Zhu Bajie, but in this neon-drenched hellscape, it felt sharper, more predatory. His stomach let out a roar that rivaled the city’s traffic, a deep, echoing protest that made his snout twitch.

He walked the streets of the lower sectors, his pig-man form hunched and weary. He kept his head down, avoiding the gaze of the cybernetic wolves and the bionic bulls that patrolled the area. Every holographic sign for "Synth-Pork" or "Bio-Bacon" felt like a personal insult. He needed real food, something that didn't taste like recycled plastic and despair.

But he was a stranger in a world without currency, a god without a temple. He couldn't just walk into a diner and order a feast.

In the shadows of a flickering billboard for neural-link upgrades, a pair of eyes watched him. They were amber, slanted, and filled with a sharp, calculating intelligence.

"You look like you've been chewed up and spat out by a black hole, big guy," a voice purred.

Bajie spun around, his hand instinctively reaching for the rake that wasn't there. Standing in the mouth of a narrow alley was a woman. She had the sleek, orange fur of a fox, her ears tipped with black tufts that twitched at every sound. She wore a tactical vest over a tattered jumpsuit, and a pair of high-tech goggles rested on her forehead.

"Who's there?" Bajie grunted, his voice thick with exhaustion.

"The name's Alice," the fox-woman said, stepping into the dim light. She held out a small, foil-wrapped bar. "And you look like you're about to faint. This is a high-protein nutrient block. It's not a five-course banquet, but it'll stop your stomach from eating itself."

Bajie looked at the bar, then at Alice. He was suspicious—he had been a Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy, and he knew that nothing in the multiverse was truly free. But his hunger was a louder voice than his caution.

He snatched the bar, tore it open, and devoured it in two bites. It tasted like chalk and synthetic chocolate, but the energy hit his system almost instantly.

"Why help me?" Bajie asked, wiping a smudge of nutrient paste from his snout.

Alice leaned against the brick wall, a sly smile playing on her lips. "Because I'm a talent scout, and you look like you've got a lot of... untapped potential. I'm looking for someone who doesn't mind getting their hands dirty. Someone who isn't afraid of a little 'extracurricular' activity."

Bajie narrowed his eyes. "If you're looking for a thief or a thug, you've got the wrong pig. I may be lost, and I may be hungry, but I am still a disciple of the Master. I don't do 'dirty' work."

Alice laughed, a sharp, barking sound. "Disciple? Master? You're a long way from home, monk. In this city, the only 'Master' is the one who pays the bills. I've got a job—a high-stakes retrieval from a corporate vault. With your bulk, you'd make a perfect distraction."

"I said no," Bajie said, his voice dropping an octave. He stepped toward her, his massive frame casting a shadow over the fox-woman. "I don't hurt people for profit. Not even for a mountain of those chalk-bars."

Alice’s smile vanished. She reached for a small, silver device on her belt—a sonic disruptor. "Listen, pork-chop. I didn't give you that food out of the goodness of my heart. You owe me. And in this sector, debts are paid in blood or service."

Bajie didn't flinch. He looked down at the disruptor, then back at Alice. Even without his rake, even without his magic, he was still a being of divine origin. The sheer weight of his presence seemed to push back against the fox-woman’s threat.

"Try it," Bajie whispered. "See if your little toy can stop a god."

Alice stared at him for a long moment. She saw the strength in his eyes, the ancient power that even the city’s suppression fields couldn't fully extinguish. She slowly took her hand off the disruptor.

"Fine," she spat, turning away. "Keep your 'honor'. See how long it lasts when the hunger comes back."

She started to walk away, then stopped and looked back over her shoulder. "If you're so determined to be a saint, go to the **Underground Market** in Sector 4. It's a pit of scum and villainy, but they're always looking for heavy lifters and night-watchmen. You can earn enough for a bowl of real noodles without having to rob a bank."

She tossed a small, glowing chip at his feet. "That's a temporary pass. Don't lose it. And don't tell them I sent you."

With a flick of her tail, Alice vanished into the shadows of the upper levels.

Bajie picked up the chip. It felt cold in his hand. He followed the directions on the city’s HUD, descending deeper into the bowels of the metropolis.

The Underground Market was a chaotic sprawl of stalls and tents, lit by flickering neon and the glow of illegal fusion generators. The air was thick with the smell of ozone, spices, and unwashed bodies. Here, the beast-men were more desperate, their cybernetics rusted and their eyes filled with a frantic energy.

Bajie found a quiet corner behind a stall selling salvaged droid parts. He sat down, his back against a cold metal pipe.

His mind drifted back to the Flaming Mountain. He saw the violet fire of Red Boy’s spear, the look of terror on the Master’s face as the vortex opened. He remembered the feeling of being torn apart, the sound of Wukong’s scream as they were separated.

"I'm coming, Master," he whispered, his eyelids growing heavy. "Just... let me rest for a moment."

In the heart of the beast-man city, surrounded by the noise of a thousand desperate souls, the former Marshal of the Heavenly Canopy fell into a fitful sleep, dreaming of golden palaces and the taste of real peaches.
