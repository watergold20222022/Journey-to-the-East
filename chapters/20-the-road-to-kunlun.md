The discovery of the Golden Staff had changed everything. It wasn't just an artifact anymore; it was an anchor point. Back in the labs of the Special Research Group, the mood had shifted from desperate improvisation to calculated industrial frenzy.

"We have a lock," Alice announced, her voice echoing through the command center. She stood before a massive holographic map of the local star cluster. "The resonance from the staff is acting like a quantum beacon. It's pointing to a specific coordinate in the Ninth Sector. Planet Kunlun."

Zhu Bajie leaned forward, his heart pounding. "Kunlun? The abode of the Immortals?"

"In our charts, it's a rogue planet," General Rakafa corrected, reading from a datapad. "A crystalline world drifting in the Void. It's considered uninhabitable. No atmosphere, extreme radiation, and surrounded by a gravity well that crushes standard ships like tin cans."

"Then we don't use a standard ship," Bajie said, looking out the viewport at the orbital dockyards.

Floating in high orbit was the carcass of the *Prometheus*, the flagship of the defeated human fleet. It was receiving a massive overhaul. Swarms of repair drones moved over its hull like ants on a beetle.

"The humans built it for war," Alice said, tapping the screen. "But we're rebuilding it for travel. We've stripped the weapon systems to make room for enhanced shield generators. We're installing a dual-phase warp drive."

"Who is doing the work?" Tybalt asked, watching the screen. "That looks like... human tech."

"It is," Alice smiled. "We couldn't have done it without help."

She keyed a command, and a face appeared on the secondary monitor. It was a digital avatar—a geometric face composed of shifting blue light.

*“Greetings, Captain Bajie,”* the synthesized voice of ARES-9 spoke. *“Systems integration is at 78%. The conversion of my former combat sub-routines into navigational aids is proceeding ahead of schedule.”*

Bajie stared at the AI. Weeks ago, he had smashed its core. Now, thanks to Alice's reprogramming and Bajie's own "spiritual baptism" of the machine, the Silicon Legion had been repurposed. They were no longer invaders; they were the workforce the Beast-Men desperately needed.

"You're behaving yourself, ARES?" Bajie asked, crossing his arms.

*“I have calculated the probability of betraying you,”* the AI replied calmly. *“It results in a 100% chance of my permanent deletion via celestial rake. Cooperation is the logical path to survival. Furthermore... the data you possess regarding the 'Great Sage' is fascinating. I wish to see this being who defies the laws of physics.”*

"Good answer," Bajie grunted.

The shipyard was a symphony of sparks and laser welding. Thousands of robot drones worked alongside Beast-Man engineers. Rhinoceros-Men welded hull plates next to spider-bots; Monkey-Men calibrated sensors with precision AI assistants. It was a union of flesh and steel that the galaxy had never seen before.

"The voyage to Kunlun will take three weeks," Rakafa said. "Even with the new drives. And once we get there, the radiation shielding might not hold."

"It will hold," Bajie said, his voice firm. "Because I'll be sitting on the hull if I have to, holding it together with magic."

He looked at Alice. "You don't have to come, you know. This is a one-way trip into a radioactive hellscape."

Alice adjusted her collar, checking her reflection in the glass. "And miss the chance to meet the Monkey King? No way. Besides, someone has to make sure you don't crash the ship into a star."

"I'm coming too," Tybalt said, sharpening his claws. "Someone needs to watch your back when you inevitably annoy a god."

Bajie laughed, a deep, belly-shaking sound that he hadn't made in a long time. He looked at the *Prometheus*—now repainted with the emblem of the Beast-Man Alliance.

"The Road to Kunlun is open," Bajie declared. "Let's go get my brother."

The engines of the great ship flared to life, a blue star igniting in the darkness, ready to bridge the gap between the lost disciple and the lonely sage.
