# Chapter 48: The Rebirth in Stone

The screams of the energy fragments were becoming unbearable. Tang Seng fell to his knees, his hands covering his ears, though he knew the sound was echoing directly in his mind.

"We cannot leave him like this," Tang Seng gasped, looking up at the galaxy of tormented crystals. "We must gather him. We must make him whole."

Ao Lie stepped forward, his face pale in the harsh light of the ion-shield. He reached into his robes—or rather, reached into his own chest, his hand passing through flesh as if it were water—and pulled out a glowing sphere.

It was a Dragon Pearl. But unlike the blazing white pearls of legend, this one was dim, pulsing with a faint, erratic gray light.

"This is the Pearl of the Lost Sea," Ao Lie explained, his voice weak. "It has the power to call back wandering spirits. It acts as a magnet for the soul. If I can activate it, it could pull Eldest Brother's Qi out of these rocks and bind them together."

He held the pearl up, closing his eyes and chanting a spell of binding. The pearl flickered, emitting a weak pulse. A few nearby crystals dimmed, the energy inside stirring, but then the light died.

Ao Lie stumbled, coughing blood. "It is no use. The atmospheric pressure... the lack of spiritual accumulation... my cultivation is throttled here. I cannot generate the ignition spark."

"Allow me," Sentry-7 stepped in, its optical lens zooming in on the pearl. "Scanning object."

A grid of red laser light swept over the mystical sphere.

"Analysis: Object is a hyper-dense containment vessel composed of organic calcium and compressed psionic matter," Sentry reported. "It operates on a resonant frequency of 432 hertz, but it requires a massive kinetic input to initiate the gravimetric field."

"Can you do it?" Tang Seng asked, supporting the swaying Dragon Prince.

"I do not possess 'mana'," Sentry stated. "However, I can replicate the vibrational trigger using a sonic emitter and a targeted electron injection. essentially, I can 'jump-start' the artifact."

"Do it," Ao Lie said, holding the pearl out with trembling hands. "Be careful. If it shatters, my soul goes with it."

Sentry-7 extended a fine, needle-like probe from its index finger. Sparks of blue electricity danced at the tip. With surgical precision, the robot touched the surface of the Dragon Pearl.

*ZZZT.*

A high-pitched whine filled the cavern. The Pearl vibrated violently, slipping from Ao Lie’s hand and hovering in the air, suspended by the conflicting magnetic fields.

"Harmonic resonance achieved," Sentry announced, its cooling fans roaring. "Initiating soul-siphon protocol."

The Pearl suddenly turned a blinding, brilliant white. It spun like a miniature star, creating a vortex of wind that whipped Tang Seng’s robes around him.

The effect on the cave was instant.

The screaming stones fell silent. From the ruby stalactites, the sapphire boulders, and the emerald veins, streams of golden light were ripped free. They looked like liquid fire, flowing through the air, drawn inexorably toward the spinning Pearl.

"It's working!" Tang Seng cried out, shielding his eyes.

But the Pearl did not just absorb the energy. It began to pull the physical matter of the cave as well.

Small rocks, dust, and shards of crystal lifted off the ground. They swirled around the golden light, clumping together, fusing under the intense heat of the compressed Qi.

First, a skeletal structure of diamond-hard quartz formed.
Then, musculature made of red granite wrapped around it.
Finally, a skin of smooth, golden sandstone sealed the form.

The light of the Pearl vanished, buried deep within the chest of the new creation.

The vortex stopped. The cave fell into a heavy, ringing silence.

Standing in the center of the crater was a statue. It was a monkey, carved from the living stone of the alien planet. It was curled in a fetal position, motionless.

"Wukong?" Tang Seng whispered, stepping past the shield boundary.

Crack.

A fissure appeared on the stone face. Then another on the chest.

With a sound like a mountain breaking, the stone shell shattered.

A figure knelt in the debris. He looked like Wukong—the same golden fur, the same compact, powerful build. But his armor was gone, replaced by a simple pelt of moss and stone-dust.

The Monkey King slowly stood up. He stretched his limbs, his joints popping with the sound of grinding rocks. He unclenched his fists, looking at his own hands with intense curiosity.

Then, he opened his eyes.

They were gold. But they were not the Fiery Golden Eyes that could see through demons. They were clear, innocent, and empty like a mirror.

"Wukong!" Tang Seng rushed forward, tears streaming down his face. "You have returned! We found you!"

He reached out to hug his disciple.

The Stone Monkey stepped back, a look of confusion crossing his face. He tilted his head, looking at the weeping monk, the exhausted dragon, and the white robot.

"Who are you?" the Monkey asked. His voice was the same, but the tone was different—younger, softer.

Tang Seng froze. "I... I am your Master. Tang Sanzang."

The Monkey blinked. He looked around the cave, then back at them. There was no recognition. No spark of memory.

"Master?" the Monkey repeated, testing the word. He scratched his head. "I do not know you. I do not know... me."

He looked at his hands again. "I am stone. I woke up."

Ao Lie lowered his sword, his expression heartbroken. "The Pearl gathered his soul... but not his memories. He is rewritten."

Tang Seng looked at the stranger wearing his disciple's face. The joy of reunion turned into a cold knot of dread. Wukong was here. But the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven... was gone.

"It does not matter," Tang Seng said, wiping his tears and forcing a smile. He extended a hand. "You are alive. That is a start."

The Stone Monkey looked at the hand, then tentatively reached out and touched it. His fingers were cold.

"Alive," the Monkey murmured. "Okay."
