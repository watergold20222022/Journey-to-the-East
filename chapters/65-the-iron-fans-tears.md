# Chapter 65: The Iron Fan's Tears

"Look at you," Princess Iron Fan whispered, her hand reaching out but not daring to touch the black metal of his chest plate. "What have you done to yourself?"

"I evolved," Red Boy said coldly. He stepped past her, entering the great hall.

It was unrecognizable. The throne of obsidian and skulls was gone, replaced by a comfortable meditation mat. The walls, once hung with the weapons of defeated enemies, were now decorated with holographic scrolls of sutras.

"Where is the Palm Leaf Fan?" Red Boy demanded, turning on his heel. "Where is the weapon that could blow out the sun?"

"It is sealed," his mother said, closing the doors behind them to keep the guards out. "We do not use it anymore. We have found peace, Hong-er. And we prayed every day that you would find it too."

"Peace?" Red Boy laughed, a harsh, jagged sound. "You call this peace? You are a tiger pulling a cart! You are a dragon eating grass! You have let the Bodhisattva gelover you."

"She saved us!" Iron Fan shouted, her temper flaring. "She spared your life! She gave us a chance to be more than just monsters in a cave!"

"She put me in a box for three hundred years!" Red Boy roared. The violet flames in his eyes flared, and the holographic scrolls on the walls withered and vanished. "She didn't save me. She threw me away."

"We tried to visit," Iron Fan wept, tears streaming down her face. "But the dimension was sealed. We could only wait."

"Waiting is for the weak," Red Boy said. "I am done waiting. I am going to kill the Monkey. And then I am going to burn the Bodhisattva's temple to ash."

Iron Fan gasped. "No. You cannot. Wukong... he is not your enemy anymore. He is on a holy mission."

"He is a thief and a fraud!" Red Boy smashed his fist onto a table, turning it to dust. "And you... you defend him? After what he did to Father? After he humiliated our family?"

"He saved your father!" Iron Fan cried. "If Wukong hadn't stopped the Heavenly Court, we would all be dead! You were too young to understand the politics, the impossible choices..."

"I don't care about politics!" Red Boy screamed. He looked like a child again, despite the terrifying armor. A child screaming at the injustice of the world. "I care that I am the only one who remembers who we were!"

Iron Fan reached into her robe. For a second, Red Boy flinched, expecting a weapon.

But she pulled out a small, old toy. A wooden rattle, carved in the shape of a flame. It was clumsy, handmade.

"Your father made this," she said softly. "When you were born. Before the wars. Before the armor. Remember, Hong-er. You were loved."

Red Boy stared at the toy. The Shadow Flame in his chest hissed. The Prince of Night's voice whispered in his ear: *Sentimental garbage. Burn it.*

Red Boy reached out. He took the rattle.

His hand trembled.

Then, slowly, deliberately, he clenched his fist. The wood splintered. It turned to black ash and slipped through his metal fingers.

"The boy you loved died in the dark," Red Boy said, looking his mother in the eye. "I am all that's left."

Iron Fan fell to her knees, sobbing. "Then you are lost. Truly lost."

"I know," Red Boy said. "Now, tell me where Father is. Or I will tear this palace apart to find him."
