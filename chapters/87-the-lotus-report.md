# Chapter 87: The Lotus Report

The Potalaka Station orbited in the quiet void of the South Sea Nebula. It was a place of meditation and high-band data processing, a station made of purple bamboo composites and white ceramic shielding.

Nezha’s ship docked silently. He walked the long, silent corridors, his footsteps echoing on the polished floor. He carried his helmet under his arm. His face was set in grim determination.

He reached the central chamber. The observation deck was a dome of transparency, looking out into the swirling purple gases of the nebula.

Guanyin sat there. She was not in her battle armor, but in a simple white robe of nanofiber. She floated slightly above the floor, surrounded by holographic screens displaying data streams from a thousand sectors.

"Marshal Nezha," she said, her voice calm and resonant as a bell. She didn't turn around. "You have returned."

Nezha knelt on one knee, bowing his head. "Bodhisattva. I am here to report."

"Rise," she said. The screens flickered and vanished. She turned to face him. Her cybernetic eyes were soft, pools of compassionate blue light. "Give me your report."

Nezha stood, but he couldn't meet her gaze. "Mission Report: Sector 7, Planet Lament. The King of Inspiration has been terminated. The illegal mining operation has been dismantled. The... local population has been secured and transferred to the Galactic Guard."

"And the secondary objective?" Guanyin asked gently. "The fugitive? The Red Boy?"

Nezha swallowed hard. This was it. The end of his career.

"The fugitive... escaped," Nezha said, his voice tight. "I engaged him in combat on the moon Crateris. He utilized a high-level void technique to break contact and fled the system. I failed to apprehend him."

He took a breath. "I take full responsibility for this failure. I allowed personal feelings to compromise my tactical judgment. I am prepared to surrender my command and accept disciplinary action."

Silence stretched in the room. Nezha waited for the reprimand. For the order to strip him of his rank.

Instead, he heard a sound he didn't expect.

Guanyin chuckled.

Nezha looked up, startled. "Bodhisattva?"

"Oh, Nezha," she shook her head, a smile touching her lips. "Do you really think I sent you there just to put handcuffs on a child?"

She waved her hand. A hologram appeared in the air between them. It was a recording.

It showed the robot army defending the children. It showed Red Boy teaching a little girl how to weld. It showed the two of them, Prince and Demon, standing back-to-back against the King of Inspiration.

"I have been watching," Guanyin said. "I saw everything."

"Then you know I let him go," Nezha said. "I let a dangerous weapon walk free."

"Did you?" Guanyin asked. "Was the Red Boy who left Lament the same one who burned the Fire Cloud Cave? The same one who threatened our supply lines?"

Nezha thought about it. He thought about Red Boy's hands, stained with grease instead of blood. He thought about the look in his eyes when he talked about the 'kindergarten'.

"No," Nezha admitted. "He changed."

"He changed because of you," Guanyin said. "The Hoop of Discipline is a powerful tool, Nezha. But it only constrains the body. To change a soul... that requires trust. Requiring someone to be better than they are, until they believe it themselves."

She deactivated the hologram.

"You didn't fail, Nezha. You succeeded where everyone else would have failed. You didn't just defeat an enemy; you created a potential ally. You showed him that strength can be used to build, not just destroy. That is the true victory of the Buddhist Way."

Nezha felt a weight lift from his shoulders that he hadn't realized he was carrying. "So... I am not under arrest?"

"Hardly," Guanyin turned back to the nebula. "The journey is far from over. The Pilgrim continues his path to the West. He will need his protectors. Return to the main fleet. Join Wukong and the others. The real war is still ahead."

Nezha bowed deeply, lower than before. "Understood. Thank you, Bodhisattva."

He turned to leave. At the door, he paused.

"He said he wouldn't go easy on me next time," Nezha said.

Guanyin smiled. "I'm counting on it. Go now, Lotus Prince."

Nezha walked out of the chamber. He didn't look back. He strode down the corridor, his step light, his wheels spinning to life at his ankles.

He was a warrior. He was a protector. And for the first time in a long time, he felt like he was on the right path.

The stars outside the viewport shone bright and clear.
