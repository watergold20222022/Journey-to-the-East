# Chapter 66: The Bull and the Boy

"You are loud," a deep voice rumbled from the shadows of the High Hall. "Just like I was."

The Bull Demon King sat on a simple stone bench, staring out a window at the green mountains. He wasn't wearing his battle armor. He wore a farmer's tunic, his massive frame hunched as if carrying an invisible weight.

"Father," Red Boy said, his voice dripping with disappointment. "Look at you. You look... domesticated."

The Bull Demon King turned slowly. His eyes were tired, but when they landed on Red Boy's black armor, they narrowed.

"And you look like a weapon," the Bull said. "Who owns you now, Son?"

"I own myself," Red Boy snapped. "I broke out of the Eternal Hell. Alone. Without your help."

"I know," the Bull sighed. "I felt the disturbance in the Qi field. You made a deal with the Shadow."

"I made a deal with power!" Red Boy shouted. "While you sat here gardening! Why didn't you come for me? Why did you let Wukong walk away?"

"Because Wukong was right," the Bull said heavily. "The Heavenly Court... the wars... it was all a cycle of destruction. Someone had to stop it. Wukong took the hard path."

"Wukong is a coward!" Red Boy spat. "He's running away! He's lost his memory and turned into a child because he couldn't handle the guilt!"

The Bull Demon King laughed. It was a dry, humorless sound.

"Is that what your Shadow Master told you?" the Bull asked. "That Wukong is an amnesiac child?"

"I felt his soul signature," Red Boy said uncertainly. "It was weak. Small."

"Wukong was here," the Bull said. "Not long ago. He stood where you are standing now. He was not a child. He was fully grown, fully aware, and bearing the weight of the universe on his shoulders."

Red Boy froze. "What?"

"He went to Planet Kunlun," the Bull continued. "To the Archive of Souls. He is looking for something. Or someone. But he is *not* lost. If your master told you he is weak, he lied."

Red Boy's mind reeled. The Prince of Night had said Wukong was rebooted. A pawn. But his father... his father never lied.

"Why would he lie?" Red Boy whispered.

"To give you hope," the Bull said. "To make you think you have a chance. Because if you knew the truth—that the Monkey King is approaching his zenith—you might not have taken the deal."

"No!" Red Boy ignited his Void Spear. "You are trying to scare me! You want me to give up!"

"I want you to live!" The Bull stood up, his massive shadow engulfing the room. "You are walking into a trap, Son! The Shadow does not give gifts. It gives loans with infinite interest!"

"I don't care about the interest!" Red Boy raised his spear, pointing it at his father's chest. "I am going to Kunlun. I will find him. And if he is strong... good. It will make his death more satisfying."

"You are a fool," the Bull growled, his eyes beginning to glow red. Steam snorted from his nostrils. "If you leave this room, you leave as my enemy."

"I haven't been your son for a long time," Red Boy said.
