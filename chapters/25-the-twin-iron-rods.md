The reunion had settled into a comfortable, albeit surreal, silence. The grey wind of the desolate Kunlun timeline howled outside the canyon, but within the shelter of the crystal spires, the group sat in a circle.

"I brought you a gift," Bajie said, wiping the last of the grime from his face. He reached behind his back, fumbling with the heavy magnetic clamps on his armor.

Wukong picked at his ear with a claw. "Unless it's a peach from the celestial orchard or a jug of immortal wine, I'm not interested, Pig."

"Better," Bajie grunted. With a heavy *thud*, he dropped a long, black iron rod onto the ground. The crystal floor cracked instantly under its weight. "Before we left Planet Kara, I went back down that drill shaft. Alice helped me rig a gravity-neutralizer to carry it. It's yours, Brother."

Wukong stared at the weapon. The golden bands at either end glimmered even in the dim light. The dragon patterns etched into the iron were unmistakable. It was the *Ruyi Jingu Bang*. The Golden-Hooped Rod.

"You found it," Wukong whispered, reaching out to touch the cold metal. "On the Beast-Man world?"

"Buried deep in the core," Bajie nodded. "It saved the planet. It... it called to me."

Wukong's expression shifted from awe to confusion. He pulled his hand back. Slowly, he reached into his own ear.

"That's impossible," Wukong said.

He pulled. A tiny needle appeared in his fingers. He blew on it. *Fwoosh.* It expanded instantly into a massive iron staff, identical to the one Bajie had dropped.

Wukong slammed his staff into the ground next to the other one.

*CLANG.*

The sound was deafening. The two weapons vibrated in perfect unison, creating a harmonic resonance that made Tianji's sensors scream.

"Two," Alice gasped. "There are two of them."

Bajie looked from one to the other, his eyes wide. "But... the Golden Staff is unique. It was the pillar that measured the depths of the Milky Way. There can't be two."

"Analyze," Wukong commanded, looking at the robot.

Tianji stepped forward, his eyes scanning rapidly. "Mass: Identical. Molecular composition: Identical, Divine Iron density. Energy signature: Identical. Quantum dating..." He paused. "Here is the variance."

He pointed to Wukong's staff. "This object has existed in this timeline for 5,000 years."

He pointed to Bajie's staff. "This object has existed in the timeline of Planet Kara for 5,000 years. Their histories are distinct, yet their origin is singular."

"The Multiverse," Alice realized. "It's the only explanation."

"Correct," Tianji straightened up. "When the Red Boy activated the Samadhi Fire vortex, he did not merely scatter you across space. He scattered you across the branches of reality. Planet Kara exists in a universe where Wukong... perhaps died, or lost his weapon? And this Planet Kunlun exists in a universe where he kept it."

"So," Bajie swallowed hard. "In that universe... on Planet Kara... there was another Pig? Another Monkey? Another Master?"

"Statistically, yes," Tianji said. "There are infinite versions of you. Some who completed the journey, some who failed. Some who are heroes, some who are villains."

A heavy silence fell over the group. The uniqueness of their suffering, their struggle, suddenly felt diluted. If there were infinite Wukongs, did this one matter? If there were infinite Masters, was their mission just one meaningless grain of sand in a desert?

"We're just copies," Bajie slumped against the rock. "Shadows of shadows."

"No," Wukong said.

The Monkey King stood up. He grabbed his staff—*his* staff—and twirled it, the wind roaring. Then he reached down and picked up the second staff. It was heavy, but he hefted them both, one in each hand, like dual-wielding chaos.

"Look at me," Wukong barked. His eyes burned with a fierce, golden fire. "Does the universe care about math? Maybe. But I don't."

He clashed the two staffs together, sending sparks flying.

"There might be a million Wukongs out there," he snarled. "Some might be smarter. Some might be stronger. But are they standing here? No. I am."

He pointed one staff at Bajie, and the other at the sky.

"And there might be a million Tang Sengs. But only *one* nagged me for 14 years. Only *one* gave me this name. And only *one* is waiting for *us* to save him."

"He is my Master," Wukong said, his voice dropping to a dangerous growl. "And I don't care if I have to burn down every single one of these 'multiverses' to find him. He is the only one that matters."

Bajie looked up at his brother. The despair in his chest began to fade, replaced by the old, familiar heat of loyalty.

"You're right," Bajie stood up. "He's our Master."

"And now," Wukong grinned, holding up the two legendary weapons. "I have two battering rams. I pity the gods who try to stop us."

Alice smiled, though she looked worriedly at the sky. "So, we have the firepower. We have the team. But we're still stuck in the wrong timeline. How do we find the Master?"

"We follow the trail," Wukong said. "Now that I know the game isn't just space, but time and reality... I know exactly where to start looking."
