# Chapter 56: The Rust Lords

The ambush began not with a roar, but with a screech of tearing metal.

From the rusted bulkheads above, shapes descended—spidery, multi-limbed machines welded together from scrap parts. Their eyes were chaotic clusters of salvaged sensors, glowing with predatory red light.

One of them, a hulk of oxidized iron with a buzzsaw for an arm, dropped directly in front of Tang Seng.

"Flesh," it synthesized, its voice sounding like grinding gears. "Water. Carbon. Rare."

Tang Seng didn't flinch. He planted his staff firmly. "We are travelers. We seek only passage."

"Payment," the Rust Lord hissed. It lunged.

*CLANG*

The buzzsaw met a length of rebar. Sparks showered Tang Seng's robes, but the monk stood still as Little Stone intercepted the blow.

The boy was half the size of the machine, but he didn't budge. He looked up at the Rust Lord, his eyes flashing gold.

"You talk too much," Little Stone said.

With a grunt of exertion, he shoved. The massive machine staggered back. Little Stone spun his rod, gaining momentum, and struck the Rust Lord's knee joint. The metal buckled.

"Get them!" Ao Lie shouted, parrying a rusted spear from another attacker.

The cavernous hull of the dead ship turned into a battlefield. There were dozens of them—scavengers who had forgotten their original programming, evolved into tribal cannibals of the machine world.

Little Stone moved like liquid mercury. He wasn't just fighting; he was dancing.

He vaulted over a swinging chain-whip, landed on a Rust Lord's shoulder, and drove his rod into its sensory cluster. He kicked off, twisting in mid-air to deflect a bolt of plasma aimed at Sentry-7.

"Analysis," Sentry-7 stated, firing precise shots into the exposed power cores of the attackers. "Subject Zero's combat efficiency is increasing exponentially. He is adapting to the weight of the weapon."

"It's too light!" Little Stone complained, smashing a scavenger into a wall. "It bends too easy!"

He looked at the bent rebar in his hand with disdain. He threw it at an incoming enemy, piercing its chest chassis, and looked around for something better.

His eyes landed on a hydraulic piston shaft meant for a starship engine. It was thick, black, and engraved with serial numbers that looked like runes.

He grabbed it. It must have weighed three hundred pounds.

He lifted it with a grin.

"Better," he said.

The largest of the Rust Lords—a tribal chieftain wearing the skull of a transport shuttle as a helmet—roared and charged. It wielded a hammer made from a ship's anchor.

Little Stone met the charge head-on.

The collision shook the floor plates. Dust rained from the ceiling.

The chieftain's hammer shattered. Little Stone's new staff held firm.

With a fluid, upward strike, Little Stone sent the massive chieftain flying into the ceiling. It hung there for a second, impaled on jagged wreckage, before crashing down, lifeless.

The remaining scavengers froze. Their collective logic processors calculated the odds: 0% chance of victory.

They dropped their weapons. They scurried back into the shadows, the metallic clicking of their retreat sounding like fear.

Little Stone stood in the center of the clearing, breathing hard. He rested the heavy piston shaft on his shoulder.

"That," he said, wiping oil from his cheek, "was a good stretch."

Tang Seng approached him, checking for injuries. "You enjoy the violence, Stone?"

Little Stone looked at the Master, his expression sobering. "No, Teacher. I enjoy... the clarity. When I fight, the noise in my head stops. I know exactly where I am."

Ao Lie sheathed his sword, looking at the boy with a mix of respect and wariness. "The clarity of battle is a dangerous addiction, little brother. It made the old Wukong invincible, but it also made him lonely."

Little Stone touched the golden band on his head. "I'm not lonely. I have you guys."

Sentry-7 pointed deeper into the ship's gut. "The signal is stronger. The source is close. Beyond this bulkhead lies the Hangar Bay."

They stepped over the broken bodies of the Rust Lords. The door to the hangar was sealed, but Little Stone, energized by the fight, jammed his new staff into the seam and pried it open with a groan of straining metal.

The air that rushed out was stale and cold, preserved for three millennia.

And there, sitting on a launch catapult in the center of the dark hangar, was a shape that defied the rust and decay around it.

It was sleek, teardrop-shaped, and shimmering with a pearlescent white coating that repelled the dust. It looked less like a machine and more like a solidified cloud.

"The Nimbus," Sentry-7 identified. "High-Mobility Atmospheric/Orbital Interceptor. Prototype Class."

Little Stone's eyes went wide. He walked toward it, entranced.

"It's... breathing," he whispered.
