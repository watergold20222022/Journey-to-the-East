# Chapter 88: The Frozen Prisoner and the Distant Thunder

The containment unit hissed as the final locking bolt slid into place. Through the thick cryo-glass, the broken form of the White Bone Demon was barely visible, a tangle of chrome and calcium suspended in absolute zero.

"Status confirmed," Tianji's voice was flat, devoid of emotion. He adjusted a holographic control panel. "Subject is in deep stasis. Neural activity at 0.04%. The viral payload is dormant."

Sun Wukong leaned against the cold metal wall of the laboratory, chewing on a piece of synthesized jerky. "You sure that icebox will hold her? She's slippery."

"It's not just ice, Monkey," Alice said, wiping grease from her hands. She stood by the console, looking tired but satisfied. "It's a quantum stasis field. Inside that box, time is moving so slowly that a single thought would take her a thousand years to complete. She's not going anywhere."

Zhu Bajie grunted, hefting his rake. "Good. I've had enough of skeletons for one lifetime. What do we do with her now?"

"Nothing," Alice said firmly. "I stay here. I watch her. And I help the Beast-Men rebuild. Someone has to keep the lights on while you lot go save the universe."

Bajie looked at the fox-girl. There was a moment of silence between them. They had fought back-to-back through the frozen wasteland.

"You're a good soldier, Alice," Bajie said quietly. "For a spy."

Alice smirked, though her eyes were sad. "And you're a decent hero, Pig. For a glutton."

Suddenly, the laboratory's main sensor array lit up. Red warning lights bathed the room in a bloody glow. An alarm blared, a sharp, rhythmic pulse.

"Report!" Wukong was instantly alert, the Golden Staff appearing in his hand.

Tianji’s fingers flew across the data streams. "It’s not a local breach. It’s a signal. Picking up a massive energy surge. Long-range sensors."

He expanded the star map. A red dot was pulsing violently in a distant sector.

"Sector 7," Tianji analyzed. "Planet designated as Lament. The energy readings are... illogical."

"Define illogical," Wukong demanded.

"It exceeds standard planetary combustion parameters by a factor of five hundred," Tianji said. "I am detecting traces of high-frequency celestial radiation. And... something else. A void singularity."

Wukong narrowed his eyes. He focused, letting his Golden Eyes peer through the data, sensing the spiritual resonance behind the numbers.

He felt it. A heat that could burn the sea. And a metallic, cold aura that felt like judgment.

"Heavenly Court," Wukong growled. "That's celestial energy."

"And the other one?" Bajie asked.

"Fire," Wukong said. "True Samadhi Fire. I'd recognize that smell anywhere."

"Red Boy," Bajie groaned. "That brat is still active?"

"If he's there, and Heaven is there..." Wukong's tail twitched. "Then they're fighting. That surge was a battle."

Tianji looked at them. "This Planet Lament... it is near the old pilgrimage routes. If celestial forces are active there, it could be a trap. Or a message."

"It's a lead," Wukong corrected. "We've been running blind since we left the ice. We need answers. If the Heavenly Court is deploying assets that big, they're looking for something. Maybe they're looking for us. Or maybe..."

"Maybe they found the Master," Bajie finished, his voice hopeful.

Wukong spun his staff. "Alice, keep this place locked down. If that skeleton wakes up, don't talk to it. Just vent the atmosphere."

"Understood," Alice nodded. She walked over to the console and unlocked the launch protocols for their ship. "The *Sky Rake* is fueled and ready. Tianji has upgraded the shielding."

"Tianji," Wukong looked at the old scholar. "You coming?"

Tianji looked at his laboratory, then at the stasis pod, and finally at the star map.

"My data indicates that the probability of you surviving without technical support is less than 12%," Tianji stated. "I will accompany you. To improve the odds."

"Let's go," Wukong turned to the airlock.

As they boarded the ship, the engines roared to life, shaking the ice from the landing struts. The *Sky Rake* lifted off, a streak of silver against the white wasteland, punching a hole through the clouds and vanishing into the black.

Alice watched them go on the monitor.

"Good luck, boys," she whispered. Then she turned back to the frozen demon. "Just you and me now, bone-face."
