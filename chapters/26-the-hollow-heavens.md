The adrenaline of the reunion began to fade, replaced by the crushing weight of statistics.

"The probability," Tianji stated, projecting a star map filled with billions of branching lines, "of locating a specific biological entity across infinite divergent timelines, without a quantum beacon, is approximately 1 in 10 to the power of 40."

Wukong sat on a crystal outcropping, swinging his legs. He had two Golden Staffs now, one resting on each shoulder. "So, you're saying it's hard."

"I am saying it is mathematically indistinguishable from impossible," Tianji corrected gently.

Bajie sighed, kicking at the glass gravel. "Even if we check a world a day, we'd be at it until the stars burn out. And we wouldn't know if it was *our* Master found, or just a version of him who looks the same."

Alice looked between them. "We need a new plan. But we can't make one here. This timeline... it's dying. The energy levels are dropping."

"We go back," Bajie suggested. "Back to Planet Kara. We have resources there. The fleet. The labs. We can rest, repair the *Sky Rake*, and think."

Wukong hopped down. "A retreat? It's not my style. But... my armor is itching, and I haven't eaten a decent meal in five hundred years. Lead the way, Pig."

The return journey through the quantum bridge was smoother this time. Tianji had refined the algorithm, and the *Sky Rake* glided back into the vibrant, neon-lit reality of Planet Kara.

When they touched down at the spaceport, the reception was overwhelming.

Crowds of Beast-Men—Wolf-kind, Ox-kind, Rabbit-kind—cheered as the ramp lowered. Holographic banners flashed Bajie's face. "THE savior RETURNS," they proclaimed. "GENERAL ZHU: HERO OF THE CORE."

Wukong stood at the top of the ramp, blinking in the glare of the press drones. He watched as General Rakafa marched forward, saluting Bajie with genuine reverence. He watched as young Beast-Men held up action figures of the pig-man.

"Well," Wukong murmured, leaning on his staffs. "Look at you."

Bajie flushed, rubbing the back of his neck. "It's... nothing. I just hit some things."

"You saved a world," Wukong said, his voice unusually serious. He poked Bajie in the belly with one of the staffs. "I always thought you were just a lazy glutton who carried the luggage. But while I was sitting on a rock feeling sorry for myself, you were out here becoming a General."

Bajie looked up, surprised by the lack of mockery in his brother's eyes. "I had to," Bajie said quietly. "I had nobody else to rely on."

"You did good, brother," Wukong grinned, the old mischief returning. "Don't let it go to your head. You're still ugly."

Later that night, the celebrations quieted down. The team sat on the balcony of the Governor's palace, overlooking the glowing sprawl of the Beast-Man metropolis.

Tianji was in recharge mode. Alice was asleep. Only the two brothers remained awake, sharing a jug of synthetic wine.

"It still bothers me," Wukong said suddenly, staring up at the stars.

"What?" Bajie asked.

"The Multiverse." Wukong took a long drink. "If there are infinite worlds... then there are infinite versions of everything. Infinite mountains. Infinite seas."

He shivered, a rare sight for the Great Sage who had braved the furnaces of Laozi.

"And infinite Western Heavens," Wukong whispered.

Bajie froze. He hadn't thought of that.

"If every choice creates a branch," Wukong continued, his eyes wide and hollow, "then there is a universe where the Buddha didn't trap me. A universe where he killed me. A universe where Guanyin never helped us."

He looked at his hands. "And if there are infinite Buddhas... which one is the True One? If enlightenment is singular, how can the enlightened ones be plural?"

The thought hung in the air, chilling the blood in Bajie's veins. It stripped the divinity from the world. If the gods were just copies, replicated by quantum chance, then their power wasn't absolute. It was just... math.

"It feels empty," Wukong said, his voice trembling. "Like the sky is just a painted ceiling, and behind it, there's nothing."

Bajie poured more wine, his hand shaking slightly. "Maybe," he said softly. "Or maybe... faith is the only thing that *doesn't* branch. Maybe the Master is the only constant."

Wukong didn't answer. He just tightened his grip on his twin staffs, staring into the dark, terrifying void of a universe that was too big, even for him.
