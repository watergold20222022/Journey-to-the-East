# Chapter 38: The Echo of Humanity

Tang Seng wandered through the kaleidoscopic jungle for hours. The initial panic of isolation had settled into a wary rhythm of survival. He found that the planet provided for him with an almost eerie eagerness.

When he felt thirst, he found large, cup-shaped leaves filled with sweet, clear nectar. When hunger gnawed at his stomach, he stumbled upon a grove of trees bearing luminous purple fruits. He hesitated at first, remembering the lessons of the White Bone Demon, but a small, monkey-like creature with six limbs plucked one and ate it with gusto. Tang Seng followed suit. The fruit tasted like honey and starlight, melting on his tongue and instantly restoring his energy.

"Thank you, little benefactor," he said to the creature, which chattered back happily and allowed him to stroke its velvety fur.

The animals here were uncomfortably friendly. Birds landed on his shoulders to preen his Kasaya. Deer-like grazers didn't flee as he passed; they simply watched him with large, liquid eyes. It was a Garden of Eden, untouched by the fear of predation.

As the violet sky began to deepen into twilight, casting long, indigo shadows across the forest floor, Tang Seng felt the weight of exhaustion. He needed shelter.

He spotted a rocky outcrop rising from a sea of ferns. At its base was the mouth of a cave, obscured by hanging vines. He parted the vegetation with his staff and stepped inside.

He expected damp walls, bat guano, and darkness.

Instead, he found smooth, gray panels.

The cave was not natural. The walls were lined with a matte, synthetic material that felt warm to the touch. The floor was perfectly flat. Deep inside, the fading light revealed shapes that didn't belong in a jungle: a sleek desk, a chair with ergonomic curves, and a sleeping pod with a mattress that looked pristine despite the layer of dust.

Tang Seng walked further in, his footsteps echoing softly on the metallic floor. He ran a hand over the desk. It was real. This was... technology. Human technology.

"Is... is anyone here?" he called out, his voice trembling slightly. "Benefactor?"

Nothing moved. He approached the sleeping pod. It looked inviting, far more comfortable than the mossy ground outside. He sat on the edge, the material yielding perfectly to his weight.

"This is not a demon's lair," he muttered to himself. "This is a home."

Suddenly, a soft chime filled the air. A holographic strip along the ceiling flickered to life, casting a gentle amber glow over the room.

"Bio-signature detected," a voice spoke. It was synthetic, calm, and genderless. "Welcome, guest. It has been a long time since visitors arrived at Outpost 42."

Tang Seng jumped up, clutching his staff. "Who is there? Are you a spirit of this mountain?"

"I am the Station Intelligence," the voice replied. "Designation: Sentry-7. I manage the environmental systems and data archives of this facility."

"Station..." Tang Seng lowered his staff slightly. "Where are your masters? The ones who built this?"

The lights in the room brightened, revealing banks of silent machinery and dusty screens against the back wall.

"The Colonist Expedition Team Alpha departed exactly nine hundred and ninety-seven Earth years, four months, and twelve days ago," the AI recited.

"A thousand years..." Tang Seng breathed. "They... they left?"

"Affirmative," the AI said. "This planet, cataloged as 'Veridia Prime,' was deemed suitable for habitation but ultimately rejected for long-term colonization due to... psychological incompatibility metrics."

"Psychological incompatibility?" Tang Seng asked, confused. "But it is paradise out there. The food is plentiful, the animals are kind."

"Precisely," the AI responded. "The lack of struggle was deemed detrimental to the human psyche over extended periods. The colonists grew bored. They packed up their primary equipment and returned to the Galactic Core, leaving this observation post dormant."

Tang Seng sank back onto the bed. Humans. They had been here, touched this world, and rejected it because it was *too* perfect. It was a profoundly human thing to do.

"So, I am truly alone," Tang Seng whispered.

"You are the only sapient biological entity currently on the scanner," the AI confirmed. "However, my power cells are still at 40% capacity. I can provide climate control, synthesized water, and access to the historical database. Would you like me to dim the lights for sleep cycle?"

Tang Seng looked around the clean, sterile room. It was a ghost of a civilization that had moved on a millennium ago. But right now, it was a sanctuary.

"Yes," Tang Seng said softly, lying down on the thousand-year-old bed. "Please. And... thank you, Sentry-7."

"You are welcome, guest. Sleep well."

The amber lights faded to a soft, comforting glow. Tang Seng closed his eyes, surrounded by the hum of ancient machines, wondering if his disciples were also looking up at this same alien sky, or if they were a thousand years away.
