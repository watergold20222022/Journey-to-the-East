title: "The White Bone Throne"
order: 33

The doors to the sanctum didn't just open; they disintegrated. Wukong’s staff smashed through the bone-reinforced porcelain, sending shards flying like shrapnel.

The chamber beyond was a cathedral of death. Rib-arches stretched a hundred meters high, supporting a ceiling that pulsed with a rhythmic, wet green light. At the far end sat a throne made of fused skulls, and upon it lounged a woman of terrifying beauty.

Her skin was pale as moonlight, her robes woven from silver wire and dried sinew. Half her face was flawless human perfection; the other half was a skull of polished chrome and crystal.

Baigujing. The White Bone Demon.

Beside her, suspended in a stasis field, floated the stolen Golden Staff. And below it... a glass coffin containing a withered, sleeping monk.

"You are persistent," Baigujing purred. Her voice echoed from the walls, not her mouth. "I thought I digested you centuries ago, Monkey. And you, Pig. Did you crawl out of my latrine?"

"We're fresh meat," Wukong snarled, stepping over the threshold. "And we're bad for your digestion."

"Kill them," Baigujing waved a hand.

The floor erupted. Thousands of bone spikes shot upward. Wukong vaulted into the air, spinning his staff to shatter them, but they grew back instantly, twisting like vipers to ensnare Bajie's legs.

"She controls the whole tower!" Bajie yelled, hacking at the calcified vines with his rake. "The room is the weapon!"

Baigujing laughed, rising from her throne. She floated into the air, the chrome half of her face glowing. "I am the Calcium Sovereign! I am the structure of life itself! You cannot break me!"

She clenched her fist. The walls closed in, rib-cages transforming into crushing jaws. Wukong was pinned, his golden armor screeching under the pressure.

"Tianji!" Wukong grunted, straining against the weight of the massive bones. "Now would be a good time!"

The robot stepped forward. He hadn't moved during the initial ambush. He stood in the center of the chaotic room, perfectly still.

"Analyzing structural composition," Tianji's voice was different. Deeper. It resonated not just in the air, but in the mind. "Target is 90% calcium-phosphate, 10% dark matter energy binding."

Tianji raised his hand. His silver skin seemingly liquefied, expanding into a cloud of shimmering grey dust.

"Protocol: Divine Deconstruction," Tianji announced.

The dust cloud didn't just fly; it flowed. It was a swarm of billions of nanobots, but they moved with a singular, terrifying intelligence. They washed over the crushing bone walls like a silver tide.

Where the silver touched the white, the white simply... ceased to exist.

The nanobots didn't break the bone; they disassembled it. Atom by atom. Molecule by molecule. The crushing spikes dissolved into harmless grey powder. The walls lost their cohesion and collapsed into sand.

Baigujing shrieked—a sound of genuine fear. "What magic is this? Samadhi Fire? True Water?"

"It is not magic," Tianji stepped through the dissolving wall, his form reforming from the swarm. He looked like a silver god, constantly shifting, impossible to grasp. "It is Engineering. I am rewriting your lattice."

He pointed at Baigujing. The silver swarm engulfed her.

"No! My immortality!" she screamed as her silver robes turned to dust. The bone armor covering her legs evaporated.

Wukong seized the moment. "Bajie! Clear the lane!"

Bajie roared, activating his jet-boosters. He flew like a missile, smashing through the last line of bone golems guarding the throne. "Incoming!"

Wukong summoned a nimbus cloud—not the magical one, but a sonic-boom generated by pure speed. He shot through the opening Tianji and Bajie had created.

Baigujing tried to reform, pulling calcium from the floor to build a shield. But Tianji's nanobots were already in the structure, denying her command. The connection was severed.

"You're expired," Wukong said, appearing right in front of her.

He didn't use full force. He didn't need to. He placed the tip of his Golden Staff against the chrome half of her skull.

"Expanding Size: One ton."

*CRACK.*

The chrome skull shattered. Baigujing was launched backward, crashing into her own throne, which crumbled into dust under Tianji's influence.

She lay amidst the ruins of her power, a broken, pale thing. The green light in the ceiling flickered and died.

"Impossible..." she grasped, black blood leaking from her mechanical eye. "I am... eternal..."

"You're a pile of bones," Wukong said, landing softly next to her. He reached out and grabbed the stolen Golden Staff from the failing stasis field. It hummed in his hand, happy to be home.

He crossed the two staffs over his chest.

"And school is out," Wukong said.

Tianji recalled his swarm. The silver dust flowed back into his body, solidifying into his familiar robotic form. But his eyes remained glowing with a blue light that felt older than the stars.

"Target neutralized," Tianji said calmly. "Atmospheric toxins clearing. The Master is safe."

Wukong looked at the robot, then at the shattered room. "Remind me never to make you angry, Tin Man. That was... celestial."

"It was efficient," Tianji replied.
