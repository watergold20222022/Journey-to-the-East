# Chapter 74: The Storm Eater

Red Boy did not need a spaceship.

He had become the ship.

He streaked through the void of System 81-X like a comet of negative light. The Samadhi Fire, once a burning red, was now a hollow crimson, edged with the vantablack of the Void. He didn't push through space; he deleted the distance in front of him, pulling the destination closer.

System 81-X was a chaotic mess. Two dying stars danced in a gravity well that ripped solar flares into ribbons of gold and sulfur.

"Get out of my way," Red Boy whispered. His voice did not travel through air; it traveled through intention.

The solar wind, usually an unstoppable force of radiation, parted before him. The particles were consumed, their energy added to his own reserves.

But something pushed back.

A massive wall of golden dust rose from the accretion disc. It wasn't just dust; it was a swarm. Trillions of microscopic drones, powered by the dying stars, coalesced into a face the size of a moon.

**"UNIDENTIFIED ENTITY,"** the voice boomed across the electromagnetic spectrum, vibrating Red Boy's very atoms. **"THIS IS THE DOMAIN OF THE YELLOW WIND. PAY THE TOLL OR BE ERODED."**

Red Boy stopped. He floated in front of the titanic face, a speck of dust against a mountain.

"I am looking for a monkey," Red Boy said. There was no fear in him. The Prince of Night had taken his fear and replaced it with hunger. "He came this way."

**"THE PILGRIMS ARE NOT HERE,"** the Yellow Wind King roared. **"BUT YOU ARE. YOU SMELL OF... WRONGNESS. YOUR EXISTENCE OFFENDS THE STORM."**

The giant face dissolved into a thousand grasping hands. The storm attacked.

It was a hurricane of solid gold. The nano-drones hit Red Boy with the force of kinetic railguns, stripping away layers of his protective field.

Red Boy laughed. It was a cold, high sound.

"You think you are big?" he mocked. "You are just dust."

He raised his hand. The Void Fire ignited.

*Concept: Consumption.*

A sphere of black fire expanded from his palm. It didn't burn the drones; it erased them. A hole, ten kilometers wide, appeared in the golden storm. The drones screamed—a digital screech of millions of units dying at once—as they were dragged into the event horizon of Red Boy’s attack.

**"INSOLENCE!"**

The Yellow Wind King escalated. The two stars of the system flared as the entity drew power directly from their photospheres. Beams of focused plasma, hot enough to glass a planet, converged on Red Boy.

Red Boy didn't dodge. He opened his mouth and *inhaled*.

The plasma beams twisted, spiraling into his maw like water down a drain. He drank the fire of the stars. His eyes glowed brighter, the crimson turning almost white.

"Spicy," Red Boy wiped his mouth. "But empty. No flavor."

He shot forward. He moved faster than sensors could track, punching a tunnel of vacuum through the storm. He aimed for the core of the Yellow Wind King's consciousness—a dense knot of processing nodes hidden deep in the nebula.

The storm condensed. The Yellow Wind King formed a body—a humanoid titan of swirling gold armor, wielding a trident made of three solidified solar flares.

The trident stabbed down, impaling the space where Red Boy had been a nanosecond ago.

Red Boy reappeared on the titan's shoulder. He drove his fist into the golden armor.

"Samadhi Void: Collapse."

The armor didn't crack. It imploded. A section of the titan's shoulder, the size of a city, simply vanished, leaving behind a smooth, spherical crater of nothingness.

The Yellow Wind King howled. The entire system shook.

**"WHAT ARE YOU?"** the entity screamed, its confidence shattered by the impossible physics of its attacker.

"I am the fire that burns the end of the book," Red Boy whispered.

He prepared to deliver the killing blow, to eat the heart of this storm god.

But then, his sensors—enhanced by the Void—picked up a new frequency. A sharp, burning thermal signature dropping out of warp speed. Fast. A needle of pure fusion fire entering the storm.

Red Boy paused, looking up through the swirling gold.

"The wind and fire wheels," he recognized the signature. "Nezha."

He smiled. The hunger in his chest growled.

"Finally," Red Boy said, ignoring the titan thrashing beneath him. "A meal worth eating."
