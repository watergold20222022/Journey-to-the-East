# Chapter 62: Shattering the Law

The white light of purification burned, but Red Boy laughed.

"You can't clean me," he snarled, his voice reverberating with the distortion of the void. "I'm not dirty. I'm *empty*."

He raised his spear. The Shadow Flame erupted, expanding into a massive, jagged sphere of darkness that swallowed the white light. The "Adaptive Defense Matrix" of the Hound faltered as its sensors registered invalid data.

*Eat,* the Prince commanded.

Red Boy lunged.

Head #3 (Space) tried to teleport him away. Red Boy grabbed the spatial coordinate and crushed it in his fist. The head imploded.

Head #4 (Matter) tried to transmute his armor into glass. The Shadow Flame consumed the transmutation wave, and the head turned to ash.

Head #5 (Logic) began to scream binary code, trying to overwrite Red Boy's mind with equations of peace. Red Boy projected his own chaotic hatred back into the stream. The head convulsed, its circuits frying from the paradox.

"System failure," the Hound's remaining heads wailed in discord. "Warden integrity at 40%. Reality stability critical."

The dimension began to crack. The "sky" of absolute black peeled away to reveal the raw, unrendered static of the multiverse beneath.

"This place isn't real!" Red Boy shouted, realizing the truth. "It's just a program! And I'm the virus!"

He grew.

Fueled by the collapsing energy of the prison, Red Boy triggered his size-alteration protocols—an old trick from his days as a demon king, but infused now with void energy. He became a giant of shadow and fire, towering over the Hound.

The Hound, once titanic, now looked like a frightened pup.

"Please," the central head (Karma) pleaded, its voice shifting to sound like Guanyin. "Mercy. Consequence."

"Mercy is a lie," Red Boy thundered. "Consequence is for the weak."

He strode forward, the "floor" dissolving under his feet into digital noise. He grabbed the remaining heads by their collective necks.

"I am the consequence," he whispered.

With a wrenching tear, he ripped the heads from the body.

The Nine-Headed Warden died.

And with it, the Eternal Hell died.

The pocket dimension shattered like a dropped mirror. Shards of black reality flew outward. The silence was replaced by the roaring, screaming wind of the space between spaces.

Red Boy floated in the center of the destruction, holding the severed, glitching heads of the beast. He absorbed their residual energy, feeling his power level spike to impossible heights.

He looked at his hands. They were trembling, not from fear, but from the rush of adrenaline. His skin was pale, his eyes completely black with violet irises. The Shadow Flame coated him like a second skin.

*Well done,* the Prince of Night said, his voice now sounding like it was standing right next to him. *You have broken the cage. The Architect's laws no longer apply to you.*

"I am free," Red Boy said.

*You are more than free,* the Prince corrected. *You are Awakened. Now... open the door.*

Red Boy looked at the swirling vortex where the Warden had stood. It was a tear in the fabric of the multiverse. Through it, he could see faint pinpricks of light. Stars.

Real stars.

He reached out and grabbed the edges of the tear. He pulled.
