# Chapter 59: Whispers in the Void

There was no time in the Eternal Hell. There was no light, no sound, no sensation. There was only the self.

For Red Boy, that self was a burning knot of pure hatred.

He floated in the absolute zero of the pocket dimension, his body preserved in the exact state it had been when the Bodhisattva banished him. His high-tech armored flight suit was powered down, its systems dead. The Samadhi Spear in his hand was cold.

In the beginning—if "beginning" had any meaning here—he had screamed. He had fired blasts of True Fire until his Qi was exhausted, trying to light up the dark. But the darkness ate the fire instant by instant. It was a prison designed by the compassionate Guanyin not to torture, but to enforce reflection.

*Reflect,* she had said. *Understand why you failed.*

"I failed," Red Boy thought, his mind projecting the words into the silence, "because I was weak."

He replayed the battle on the Flaming Mountain for the millionth time. The Monkey King's resilience. The Bodhisattva's effortless superiority. The look of pity on his mother's face.

"Creating simulation: Scenario 4,092," his internal cybernetics whispered, running on emergency reserve power. "Target: Sun Wukong. Vulnerability: None found."

"Shut up," Red Boy thought.

He was alone. He would be alone forever. The universe would age and die, and he would still be here, a ghost in a bottle.

*Are you sure about that?*

The voice did not come from his suit. It did not come from his ears. It slithered directly into his brain stem, cold and oily, like liquid nitrogen poured over a burn.

Red Boy's eyes snapped open. He saw nothing but the black.

"Who is there?" he projected mentally. "Guanyin? Are you here to mock me?"

*The Architect?* The voice laughed. It sounded like tearing silk. *No. She does not care about you, little spark. To her, you are a bug in a jar. A specimen to be shelved.*

"Show yourself!" Red Boy summoned a flicker of flame in his palm. It illuminated nothing.

*I am the space between stars,* the voice whispered. *I am the silence you fear. You may call me the Prince of Night.*

A presence coalesced in front of him. It wasn't physical; it was a negative space, a shadow darker than the surrounding void. Two points of violet light ignited within it, resembling eyes.

*You want to get out,* the Prince said. It wasn't a question.

"I will get out," Red Boy growled. "And when I do, I will burn the heavens."

*With what?* The shadow mocked. *That little candle you hold? The Architect's laws are woven into the fabric of this prison. Order. Light. Gravity. Your fire is part of her physical universe, so it obeys her rules. You cannot burn a wall made of 'No'.*

Red Boy stared at the dying flame in his hand. The stranger was right. his power was great, but it was bound by the physics of the reality he came from.

*But there is another way,* the Prince whispered, drifting closer. *A power that does not obey. A fire that burns not with heat, but with entropy. A fire that eats rules.*

"Why would you help me?" Red Boy asked, suspicious.

*Because I dislike the Architect's tidy little cages,* the Prince replied. *And because I am a connoisseur of hatred. Yours... yours is vintage. It has aged beautifully in the dark.*

A hand—long, clawed, and made of violet smoke—extended from the shadow.

*I can teach you to weave the void into your flame,* the Prince offered. *I can turn you into a paradox that this prison cannot hold. But the price...*

"I don't care about the price," Red Boy snapped. "Name it."

*The price is the 'boy',* the Prince said. *You enter this covenant as a child seeking a tantrum. You leave as a weapon of the Night. The part of you that hesitated? The part that loved your mother? The part that wanted to be like the Monkey King? That burns first.*

Red Boy hesitated for a fraction of a second. He saw his mother's weeping face. He saw his father's bowed head.

Then he saw Wukong's grin.

"Burn it," Red Boy said, reaching out to grasp the smoky hand. "Burn it all."
