# Chapter 94: Tearing the Sky

The Spider Matriarch descended from the ceiling. She was colossal, her body a nightmare fusion of black chitin and pulsars. Her legs were starship landing struts, tipped with diamond-edged blades. Her face was a cluster of sensor arrays, glowing red.

"UNAUTHORIZED DISCONNECT," her voice boomed, shaking the catwalks. "RETURN TO THE PODS. SUBMIT."

"Submit to this!" Wukong leaped into the air. He extended the Golden Staff. "BIG!"

The staff grew to the size of a skyscraper column. He swung it down on the Matriarch's head.

**CLANG.**

A force field shimmered around her. The staff bounced off.

"Kinetic shielding," Tianji analyzed, firing plasma bolts from his hand-cannons at the spider drones swarming them. "She's using the colony's power grid to shield herself. We can't hurt her while the pods are active!"

"So we turn off the power!" Wukong yelled, kicking a drone into the abyss.

"I need access to the central core!" Tianji shouted back. "It's inside her thoracic cavity!"

"Inside?" Bajie revved his rake. "Gross. I love it."

"Cover me!" Wukong ordered. He plucked a handful of hair and blew on it. "Replicate!"

Dozens of golden monkeys materialized. They weren't just illusions; they were hard-light constructs powered by his own will. They swarmed the Matriarch, distracting her sensors, prying at her leg joints.

"NOW, PIG!" Wukong yelled.

Bajie didn't hesitate. He launched himself off the catwalk, using the anti-grav boosters in his boots. He flew straight at the Matriarch.

But he didn't aim for the head. He aimed for the rack below her.

"Seven!" he roared.

He landed beside the torture rack. Seven was barely conscious, her body mutilated.

"Leave her alone!" Bajie swung his rake. The nine teeth glowed with red energy. He smashed the mechanical arms that were hurting her. Sparks showered down.

Seven opened her one remaining eye. "Marshal..."

"I'm getting you out," Bajie said, trying to lift her.

"No," Seven gasped. She pointed up at the Matriarch. "The core... she is linked to me. To all of us. If you destroy the core... we all die."

Bajie froze.

"But if you don't," Seven whispered, "we stay like this forever. Please. End it."

High above, Wukong was losing ground. The Matriarch's lasers were vaporizing his clones.

"Bajie! What are you doing?!" Wukong screamed.

Bajie looked at Seven. He looked at the millions of pods.

"End it," Seven begged. She reached up and touched his face with a broken hand. "Let me have the last dance."

Bajie closed his eyes. Tears leaked out.

"Okay," he whispered. "Last dance."

He kissed her forehead. Then he turned his boosters to maximum.

"WUKONG! OPEN IT UP!" Bajie roared into the comms.

Wukong saw Bajie coming up like a missile. He understood.

"HYAAA!" Wukong summoned every ounce of strength. He dove, driving the staff into the seam of the Matriarch's force field. The field buckled.

"TIANJI! JAM THE SIGNAL!"

Tianji unleashed a logic-virus bomb. The force field flickered for one second.

That was enough.

Bajie hit the Matriarch's chest. He didn't just hit it. He buried the Nine-toothed Rake into the armor and *pulled*.

The armor tore open. The glowing blue core was exposed.

"FOR SEVEN!" Bajie screamed.

He detonated the fuel cells in his rake.

The explosion wasn't fire. It was a pure shockwave of gravitational force.

It shattered the core. It shattered the Matriarch's spine. It shattered the neural link holding the millions of captives.

The Matriarch screamed—a sound of dying metal. She fell, crashing into the abyss, taking the web of cables with her.

The lights in the cavern died. The pods opened. Emergency release.

Bajie fell with the debris. Wukong caught him on his cloud, swooping down to grab Tianji on the way.

As they flew up towards the ship, Bajie looked back.

He saw the rack where Seven had been. It was falling into the dark heart of the planet, spinning slowly.

"Goodbye," he whispered.

***

One hour later.

The *Sky Rake* blasted out of the Gossamer Nebula. Behind them, the crystal planet was dark. The web was dissolving. The survivors would wake up. They would find ships. They would live.

Bajie sat in the co-pilot seat. He didn't look at the beautiful nebula. He looked at a small piece of red silk he held in his hand.

Wukong patted his shoulder. He didn't say anything.

Tianji piloted the ship towards the clear starlight.

"Course set," Tianji said softly. "Tracking the Lotus Prince. Sector 9. We are leaving the nebula."

Bajie tied the red silk around the handle of his rake.

"Let's go," Bajie said, his voice hard. "We have a monk to find."
