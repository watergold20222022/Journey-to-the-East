# Chapter 49: Little Stone

The exit from the Stone Valley was far slower than the entry. The group now had a fourth member, but unlike the fearsome Great Sage who could somersault across clouds, this member stopped every five steps to inspect a pebble, a leaf, or his own toes.

The reborn monkey was a blank slate. He possessed the physical agility of Wukong—leaping effortlessly onto boulders twice his height—but none of the discipline or memory. He was chaotic, pure, and utterly exhausting.

"Analysis," Sentry-7 intoned, retracting a scanner arm after the monkey tried to bite it. "Subject displays neuro-plasticity equivalent to a human infant, yet possesses Class-5 combat reflexes. It is a dangerous combination."

"He is hungry," Tang Seng observed gently. The Stone Monkey was chewing on a piece of moss with a grimace.

"Correct." Sentry-7 opened a compartment in its ceramic thigh armor. "Synthesizing nutrient paste. Flavor profile: Peach."

The robot knelt down, holding out a silver packet. The monkey sniffed it suspiciously, his golden eyes darting between the robot's glowing blue optic and the food. Then, with a lightning-fast snatch, he grabbed the packet, tore it open with his teeth, and devoured the contents.

He let out a happy chirp, hopping onto Sentry’s shoulders and patting the robot’s smooth head as if grooming a fellow ape.

"Accessing textile fabrication subroutine," Sentry announced, ignoring the monkey pulling at its antenna. "Subject requires protective covering. The dorsal fur is thick, but the extremities are vulnerable to the valley's sharp shale."

Using the remnants of the extra polymer material from Tang Seng’s survival suit and weaving it with local fibrous vines, Sentry-7’s nimble mechanical fingers set to work. Within an hour, the robot had fashioned a simple, durable tiger-skin patterned vest (digitally printed onto the polymer) and a pair of sturdy, grip-soled boots.

"Here," Sentry said, holding up the tiny shoes.

The monkey screeched and ran up a rock pillar. He hated having his feet confined.

"It is for your safety," Sentry explained patiently, emitting a low, soothing hum. It took another twenty minutes of coaxing, involving three more peach-flavored packets, before the monkey allowed the robot to dress him.

Once dressed, the monkey looked eerily like a miniature, younger version of the Pilgrim Sun. Ao Lie turned away, unable to watch.

"He looks just like him," the Dragon Prince whispered. "But the eyes... there is no fire. No 'Old Sun'."

"He needs a weapon," Sentry observed. "He keeps picking up sticks and breaking them."

"No," Tang Seng said quickly. "We do not want him to learn violence."

"He has kinetic energy to discharge," Sentry countered. "If we do not provide a focus tool, he will likely dismantle my servos or your staff."

The robot detached a spare hydraulic strut from its own back chassis. It activated a molecular reshaping protocol. The metal extended, turning into a sleek, black rod that could telescopically expand and contract. It wasn't the divine iron of the Ruyi Jingu Bang, but it was a masterpiece of human engineering—lightweight, indestructible, and perfectly balanced.

Sentry tossed the rod to the monkey.

The monkey caught it. His eyes went wide. He spun it—clumsily at first, hitting himself in the ear—but then with increasing speed. A memory of muscle, if not mind, took over. For a second, a blur of black and gold filled the air.

Tang Seng felt a phantom pain in his heart. It was so close to the truth.

"What do we call him?" Ao Lie asked, watching the monkey play with Sentry, poking the robot's chest plate with the new toy.

Tang Seng looked at the creature. He was made of the valley's rock, born of a pearl's light, and dressed by a machine. He was Wukong, and he was not.

"We cannot call him Wukong," Tang Seng said softly. "That name belongs to the one who attained enlightenment, the one who suffered under the mountain for five hundred years. This child has no burden."

He walked over to where the monkey was hanging upside down from Sentry’s arm. Tang Seng reached out and gently brushed the stone dust from the monkey's forehead.

"We will call him Little Stone," Tang Seng said.

"Little Stone," Ao Lie repeated. "Xiao Shitou."

"It fits," Sentry-7 agreed. "Lithoid origin. Diminutive stature."

Tang Seng looked deep into the clear, golden eyes of the child-monkey. "Little Stone. You will walk with us. But I name you this to remind myself, and you, that the stone has not yet become the jade. And that somewhere, the true Monkey King is still lost."

Little Stone didn't understand. He just grinned, poked Tang Seng with his nano-staff, and somersaulted away to chase a floating rock.

"Come," Tang Seng said, lifting his pack. "The Mother Tree is waiting for us to return. Maybe it can tell us why the universe decided to give us a child instead of a warrior."
