# Chapter 58: Skyward Bound

The mechanical worm roared—a sound of tearing metal and static. Its laser eye charged, a blinding red star in the dim hangar.

"Get on!" Little Stone's voice boomed from the Nimbus.

The ship dropped its rear ramp. Ao Lie grabbed Tang Seng and sprinted. Sentry-7 provided covering fire, its plasma bolts plinking harmlessly off the worm's armored scales.

"Target lock detected!" Sentry-7 warned.

A beam of cohesive light the width of a bus slashed across the hangar.

The Nimbus didn't dodge; it *danced*. It rolled sideways, defying inertia, the laser missing its hull by inches. As Tang Seng and the others scrambled up the ramp, the ship was already moving again.

Little Stone wasn't flying with instruments. He was flying with instinct. The ship felt like an extension of his own limbs. He could feel the gravity well of the planet pulling at his keel like mud on his feet, and he wanted to kick free.

"Everyone inside? Buckle up!" Little Stone laughed.

The ramp hissed shut.

"Hold on!" Ao Lie shouted, strapping Tang Seng into a passenger crash-seat.

The Nimbus accelerated. Zero to Mach 2 in three seconds.

They didn't fly out of the hangar door; they flew *through* the ceiling. The ship's nose cone generated a molecular disruption field, turning the rusted steel above them into dust as they punched through.

They erupted into the sunlight of the badlands. But the Guardian wasn't done.

The massive worm uncoiled from the earth, launching itself into the air. It was miles long, a serpent of iron pursuing a gnat. Anti-air missiles bloomed from its carapace, trailing smoke.

"It's persistent," Little Stone noted. "Annoying."

Inside the cockpit, Little Stone closed his eyes. The neural link showed him everything in a spherical grid. The missiles were slow. The worm was clumsy.

"Somersault," he whispered.

The Nimbus flipped. The entire world spun. The ship performed a maneuver that would have snapped the wings off a conventional craft, executing a hairpin loop directly into the path of the incoming missiles.

"Stone! What are you doing?" Tang Seng cried out, his stomach lurching.

"Confusing them," Little Stone said.

He triggered the ship's electronic warfare suite—or rather, he just *willed* the ship to shout. A burst of chaotic data flooded the missiles' guidance systems. They spiraled out of control, colliding with each other in a chain of fireballs.

Through the smoke, the Nimbus dove. Straight at the worm's head.

"He's going to ram it!" Ao Lie yelled.

"No," Sentry-7 said, its processor struggling to keep up. "He is... taunting it."

At the last possible microsecond, the Nimbus rolled. The ship's wingtip, hardened by the energy shield, sliced across the Guardian's primary sensory array.

Sparks showered like rain. The worm, blinded and confused, crashed back into the Iron Graveyard, creating a localized earthquake that swallowed the remains of the ancient dreadnoughts.

"Target neutralized," Sentry-7 announced. "Orbit trajectory plotted."

Little Stone pulled up.

The sky turned from dusty brown to pale blue. Then to deep indigo.

Tang Seng looked out the viewport. The curvature of Veridia Prime became visible—a scarred, green and brown marble hanging in the dark. The clouds fell away. The stars, which had been hidden by the planet's atmosphere, suddenly appeared in their billions.

The silence of vacuum replaced the roar of the engines.

"We are out," Ao Lie breathed, unbuckling his straps. "We actually made it."

Little Stone's voice came over the intercom, soft now, tired but content. "The air up here... it's so clean. Even though there isn't any."

Tang Seng unclasped his hands, which had been white-knuckled on the armrests. He looked at the vast emptiness of the cosmos stretching before them. This was the true Journey to the East. Not across a continent, but across the galaxy.

"Set a course, Little Stone," Tang Seng said gently.

"Where to, Teacher?"

"Follow the signal," Tang Seng said. "Follow the path that leads to the answers. To the truth of who we are."

"Okay," Little Stone said. "Engaging Somuch-Drive... I mean, Sub-Light Drive!"

The Nimbus flared like a new star, leaving a streak of pearlescent light against the darkness of space, heading East, deeper into the unknown.
