# Chapter 60: The Shadow Flame

Pain was the first lesson.

When Red Boy engaged his Samadhi Spear, the familiar comforting heat of the True Fire did not appear. Instead, a cold, gnawing sensation spread from his grip up his arm. It felt like frostbite, but it burned like acid.

*No,* the Prince of Night's voice echoed in his mind. *You are still trying to command it. You are trying to be the master. The Shadow Flame does not serve.*

"Then how do I use it?!" Red Boy screamed, clutching his arm. His nano-suit was alarming, reporting rapid cellular decay in his right limb.

*You do not use it to create,* the Prince instructed. *True Fire is life energy. It creates plasma. It creates light. Shadow Flame is the void. It consumes. You must become a hole in the universe. Stop projecting. Start eating.*

Red Boy gritted his teeth. He closed his eyes and visualized the void around him. He felt the immense, crushing weight of the nothingness.

Instead of fighting it, he opened himself to it. He invited the cold in.

A scream tore from his throat as the void rushed into his meridians. It clashed with the Samadhi fire in his core. It was a war of matter and antimatter inside his own chest.

"Warning," his suit's AI synthesized, its voice distorted. "Core temperature... critical failure. Integrity... negative."

*Let it die,* the Prince whispered. *Let the old Red Boy burn.*

Red Boy saw memories flashing before his eyes like burning photographs.
His father, the Bull Demon King, gifting him his first spear. *Burn.*
His mother, brushing his hair. *Burn.*
The days of playing in the magma falls of the Fire Cloud Cave. *Burn.*

He grabbed the memories and fed them to the cold. The pain shifted. It was no longer an assault; it was a hungry ache. A craving.

He opened his eyes.

He ignited the spear.

There was no flash of light. The tip of the spear simply vanished, replaced by a jagged tear in the reality of the pocket dimension. Black flames—no, not flames, but writhing tendrils of darkness edged in violet lightning—licked along the shaft.

He didn't feel hot anymore. He felt cold. A beautiful, deadly cold.

*Good,* the Prince purred. *Now, feed it.*

Red Boy looked at the darkness around him. He slashed the spear. The black tendril lashed out, striking empty space. But where it struck, the "emptiness" (which was actually a structured spatial field) *screamed*. A hairline fracture appeared in the black, revealing a chaotic swirling gray underneath.

He had cut the canvas of the dimension.

"It's... heavy," Red Boy whispered. The spear felt like it weighed a thousand tons, yet he lifted it easily. "It wants more."

*The Eternal Hell is a construct of order,* the Prince said. *It is sustained by nine anchor points. Guardian logic gates. You have awakened them.*

As if on cue, a deep, resonant growl shook the void. It wasn't sound; it was gravity waves washing over him.

In the distance, nine pairs of golden eyes opened in the darkness. They were massive, like small suns.

*The Warden creates itself,* the Prince warned. *The Nine-Headed Divine Hound. It is the immune system of this prison. It comes to purge the infection.*

Red Boy spun his spear, the black flames trailing behind it like a cape of ink. He didn't feel fear. He felt a dark, twisted joy.

"Let it come," Red Boy said, his voice now layered with a subsonic echo. "I'm hungry."
