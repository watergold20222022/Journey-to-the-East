# Chapter 36: The Lonely Return

The winds outside the White Bone Spire had died down, leaving an eerie silence over the frozen wasteland. The battle was over, but there was no sense of victory in the air—only the heavy, crushing weight of a truth that could not be undone.

Wukong and Bajie stood at the base of the Spire, watching the towering figure of this timeline's Sha Wujing. The corrupted River Demon looked different now. The madness that had fueled his attacks earlier seemed to have drained away, replaced by a profound, hollow exhaustion. He no longer looked like a monster; he looked like a broken soldier who had finally been relieved of duty.

In his massive, clawed hands, he held the reliquary containing the white bones of the Tang Monk and the tattered Kasaya. He held it with a gentleness that belied his mutated strength, shielding it from the biting cold with his own body.

"So," Sha Wujing rumbled, his voice rough like grinding ice. "It is finished."

"Brother..." Bajie started, stepping forward, but he stopped himself. The word felt wrong here. This entity shared a name and a history with his junior brother, but the distance between them—measured in years of torture and divergent timelines—was too vast to bridge with simple familiarity. "What will you do now?"

Sha Wujing looked down at the box in his hands. "Go home," he said simply. "Back to the deep ice. Back to the Flowing Sand River... or what's left of it under the glaciers."

"You could come with us," Wukong offered, though he knew the answer before he spoke. "We still have a long way to go. We have to find... well, the versions of you and the Master that belong to us."

Sha Wujing shook his head slowly. He looked at Wukong, his mismatched eyes scanning the Monkey King's face.

"You look like him," Sha Wujing said softly. "You fight like him. You even smell like him—ozone and peach blossoms. But you are not him."

"No," Wukong admitted. "I'm not."

"My Eldest Brother is dead," Sha Wujing said, the grief plain in his voice. "My Second Brother is dead. My Master is..." He tightened his grip on the reliquary. "My Master is finally found. The mission... the waiting... it is over."

He adjusted the heavy containment unit against his chest. "I do not understand your talk of other worlds. My mind is... fragmented. But I thank you. For stopping *her*. For giving me this."

He turned away, facing the endless white expanse of the north. His silhouette was jagged and hulking against the pale sky.

"Do not follow me," he rumbled. "The river is cold. It is a place for the dead and the forgotten. It is where I belong."

With heavy, thudding steps, Sha Wujing began to walk. He didn't look back. Wukong and Bajie watched him go, a solitary figure shrinking into the distance until the swirling snow swallowed him whole. He was taking the tragedy of this timeline with him, burying it under the ice where it couldn't hurt anyone else.

"He's tough," Bajie murmured, wiping his snout. "Tougher than our Sandy, maybe."

"He had to be," Wukong said quietly. "He was the last one standing."

Behind them, the hum of an anti-gravity sled signaled the arrival of the extraction team. Alice and Tianji were supervising the loading of their prisoner.

Baigujing, stripped of her nanoskin and bound in high-tensile energy cuffs, was essentially a skeletal chassis with a flickering consciousness core. She was no longer the terrifying Queen of the North; she was just hardware.

"Optimal containment achieved," Tianji reported, tapping on her datapad. "Her neural net is degraded, but there is significant data to be harvested. Specifically regarding the bio-toxin interaction with her mana circuits."

"You're taking her back to the Orc fortress?" Wukong asked, turning to face them.

"The Underground Bunker has secure facilities," Alice replied, checking the straps on the sled. She looked at the skeletal heap with cold professional interest. "If her story about the poisonous flesh is true, it changes our strategic understanding of the biological agents in this world. We need to study her. Dissect the code. See if we can synthesize the toxin—or the antidote."

"For academic research," Tianji added, her eyes flashing with data streams. "She is a unique specimen. A hybrid of mystic cultivation and viral biotechnology. The command at the base is eager to analyze the 'Trojan Horse' anomaly."

Baigujing let out a static-filled hiss, her vocal processors damaged. "You... represent... a new... hell."

"Focus on conserving your battery," Tianji advised coolly. "We have a long interrogation schedule ahead of us."

As the sled lifted off, hovering silently over the snow, Wukong felt a strange hollowness in his chest. They had won. They had liberated the North. They had solved the mystery.

But watching Sha Wujing disappear into the white void, and seeing the 'Master' reduced to a box of bones, the victory felt like ash in his mouth.

"Brother," Bajie said, kicking at a chunk of ice. "If the Master's meat really is poison... does that mean our Master is a weapon too? Is that why everyone wants to eat him? Not to live forever, but because someone *programmed* them to destroy themselves?"

Wukong looked up at the sky, where the faint shimmer of the planetary shield grid was visible.

"I don't know, Bajie," Wukong said, his grip on the Ruyi Jingu Bang tightening until the metal groaned. "But if this whole journey is a lie... then we're going to find the liar. And we're going to make them answer for every bone in that box."
