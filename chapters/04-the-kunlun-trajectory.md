# Chapter 4: The Kunlun Trajectory

The *Potala Station* was a marvel of engineering, but to Sun Wukong, it felt like a gilded cage. He spent three cycles staring at the Resonance Tracker, watching the sliver of light pulse with a rhythm he couldn't yet decipher. The multiverse was too big, and his starting point was nowhere.

He needed more than a compass. He needed a lead. And there was only one place left to look—the place where the fire had started.

Wukong descended from the orbital sanctuary, his ion-cloud cutting through the atmosphere of the volcanic moon *Rakshasa-7*, the private estate of the Bull Demon King. The moon was a jagged sphere of cooling magma and industrial refineries, its surface dotted with massive cooling towers that pumped liquid nitrogen into the crust to keep the luxury habitats from melting.

He landed on a landing pad made of reinforced tungsten. Waiting for him were two figures who looked like they had aged a thousand years in a single week.

The Bull Demon King had traded his power armor for a simple robe of heavy silk, but his massive frame still seemed to sag under an invisible weight. Beside him, Princess Iron Fan stood with her arms crossed, her eyes red-rimmed and hollow. The cooling-fan gauntlets she usually wore were absent, replaced by a simple mourning veil that shimmered with micro-LEDs.

"Wukong," the Bull Demon King rumbled. There was no anger in his voice, only a profound, echoing exhaustion.

"Brother," Wukong replied, inclining his head. "I... I didn't know if you'd see me."

"We owe you an apology, Great Sage," Iron Fan said, her voice trembling. "Our son... the Samadhi fire... we knew he was powerful, but we didn't realize he had become a monster. We were so proud of his strength that we ignored the rot in his heart."

"He wasn't a monster," Wukong said softly. "He was a warrior who lost his way. Just like I did, once."

"But you were given a chance to redeem yourself," Iron Fan cried, a single tear tracing a path through the dust on her cheek. "He has been cast into the Eternal Hell. A place where even the concept of mercy is a foreign language. To know he is alive, yet unreachable... it is a torment worse than death."

The Bull Demon King placed a heavy hand on his wife's shoulder. "We do not blame you for the Architect's judgment, Wukong. But the house of the Bull is broken. Our legacy is ash."

They stood in silence for a moment, the only sound the distant roar of the refineries and the hiss of the volcanic vents. Wukong felt the weight of their grief, a heavy, suffocating blanket. He realized that his own loss—the disappearance of the Master and his brothers—was mirrored here in the loss of a son.

"I'm looking for them," Wukong said finally. "The Master. Bajie. Wujing. They were taken by the vortex Red Boy created."

The Bull Demon King looked up, his eyes narrowing. "The Samadhi vortex? That is not a path one follows lightly, Wukong. It doesn't lead to places; it leads to possibilities."

"I have a tracker," Wukong showed them the jade device. "But I don't have a direction."

The Bull Demon King turned and looked toward the horizon, where the gas giant they orbited loomed like a bruised eye in the sky. "If you seek the lost, you must go to the place where the maps end. Beyond the Nine Heavens, in the sector they call the Void of Primordial Data."

"What's there?"

"The Planet Kunlun," the Bull Demon King said. "It is not a world of rock and water. It is a crystalline archive, a planetary-scale server that predates the Hegemony. They say the Queen Mother of the West keeps the records of every soul-code ever written there. If your friends are scattered across the multiverse, Kunlun is the only place with the processing power to find their frequency."

Wukong nodded. "Kunlun. I've heard the legends. It's guarded by the Kaiming Beast—a security AI with nine heads and a thousand eyes."

"You'll need more than your cloud to get there, Wukong," the Bull Demon King said. He gestured toward a massive hangar built into the side of a volcano. "The Nine Heavens are filled with celestial patrols and automated interceptors. You need stealth. You need speed."

The hangar doors slid open with a groan of heavy hydraulics. Inside sat a ship that looked like a shard of obsidian carved into a spearhead. Its hull was coated in a matte-black material that seemed to swallow the light, and its engines hummed with the low-frequency vibration of a contained singularity.

"This is the *Ox-Tail*," the Bull Demon King said. "A long-range scout vessel. It has its own independent AI, 'Niu-Nav', programmed with the secret routes through the celestial blockades."

"You're giving this to me?" Wukong asked, stunned.

"Consider it a dowry for a future that will never happen," Iron Fan said, her voice regaining a sliver of its former steel. "Find your friends, Wukong. And if you ever find a way to reach the Eternal Hell... tell our son we haven't forgotten him."

Wukong climbed into the cockpit. The interface was a holographic sphere that surrounded him, displaying data in a language of light.

"Welcome, Great Sage," a calm, synthesized voice spoke. "I am Niu-Nav. Destination: Planet Kunlun. Trajectory: Optimal. Stealth protocols: Active."

Wukong looked back at the two grieving parents standing on the tungsten pad. They looked small now, dwarfed by the machinery of their own making.

"Thank you," Wukong said.

He pushed the throttle forward. The *Ox-Tail* didn't roar; it vanished. A ripple in the air was the only sign it had ever been there. As the ship cleared the atmosphere and engaged its warp drive, Wukong watched the volcanic moon shrink into a tiny spark of red in the vast, uncaring blackness of space.

The journey to Kunlun had begun. And for the first time in a long time, the Great Sage felt like he was moving toward something, rather than just running away.
