# Chapter 5: The Neutron Trial

Planet Kunlun did not orbit a star. It was a rogue world, a crystalline sphere of pure data-lattice that glowed with a soft, internal bioluminescence. As the *Ox-Tail* approached, Sun Wukong saw that the surface was not made of rock, but of billions of interlocking hexagonal prisms, each one a storage unit for the history of the multiverse.

"Approaching landing coordinates," Niu-Nav announced. "Atmosphere: Synthetic. Gravity: Variable. Security clearance: Ancestral."

The ship glided through a shimmering curtain of energy—the Kaiming Perimeter—and touched down on a platform that felt like solid light. Wukong stepped out, his Resonance Tracker humming with a low, steady frequency.

The landscape was a forest of crystalline spires that reached toward a sky filled with artificial nebulae. In the center of a vast plaza, sitting on a bench made of compressed stardust, was a woman.

She looked ancient and youthful at the same time. Her hair was a cascade of silver fiber-optics, and her skin had the texture of polished porcelain. She was surrounded by a dozen floating spheres of vibrant, shifting colors—red, yellow, blue, white, and black. She was moving them with her fingers, weaving them into complex geometric patterns like a child playing with marbles.

This was Nuwa, the Mother of Creation, the Architect of the Soul-Code.

Wukong approached, his boots making no sound on the light-platform. He knelt, placing his Ruyi Jingu Bang on the ground beside him.

"Great Mother," Wukong said, his voice filled with a rare humility.

Nuwa didn't look up. She flicked a blue sphere, and it merged with a yellow one, creating a burst of green light that briefly illuminated the plaza. "The Monkey who challenged the Heavens has come to the end of the maps," she said, her voice like the chime of a thousand bells. "What do you seek in the archive of the forgotten?"

"I seek my Master, Tang Seng," Wukong replied. "He was taken by a Samadhi vortex. Guanyin said this world holds the records of all soul-codes. I need to find his frequency."

Nuwa finally looked up. Her eyes were not eyes at all, but twin galaxies, swirling with the data of a trillion lives. "The Master’s code is... elusive. It has been fractured by the vortex, scattered across the sub-layers of reality. I can find the threads, Wukong, but the processing power required is immense."

She gestured to the ground beneath them. "Kunlun is a living machine, but its core has grown cold. To restart the deep-search protocols, I need a catalyst. A Neutron Gem—a fragment of a collapsed star with a density so high it can anchor a soul-code in the void."

"Where is it?" Wukong asked, standing up.

"In the heart of the planet," Nuwa said, her expression unreadable. "The core is a high-gravity zone, a place where data becomes physical and dangerous. It is guarded by the 'Corrupted Echoes'—remnants of failed civilizations that have merged with the planet’s security systems."

"Consider it done," Wukong said, his eyes flashing gold.

Nuwa waved her hand, and a hexagonal segment of the plaza retracted, revealing a shaft that plunged into the darkness. "Go, Great Sage. Bring me the stone, and I will give you the path."

Wukong didn't hesitate. He dived into the shaft, his golden armor flaring as he accelerated.

The descent was a blur of shifting gravity and static. As he reached the core, the air became thick, like liquid lead. The walls were no longer crystalline; they were jagged, metallic structures that pulsed with a sickly violet light.

Then, the Echoes appeared.

They were monstrous shapes, half-organic and half-machine, their bodies made of discarded hardware and flickering holograms. They didn't speak; they emitted a screeching wall of white noise that threatened to scramble Wukong’s internal systems.

"Out of my way," Wukong growled.

He swung his staff, and the impact sent a shockwave through the high-density air. The Echoes swarmed him, their claws made of sharpened data-shards. Wukong moved with the grace of a solar flare, his staff expanding and contracting in a blur of motion. He wasn't just fighting monsters; he was fighting the weight of the planet itself.

He reached the center of the core, where a single, tiny stone hovered in a containment field. It was no larger than a walnut, but it glowed with a white light so intense it was painful to look at. The Neutron Gem.

As he grabbed the stone, the gravity tripled. The Echoes let out a final, deafening roar and dissolved into static. Wukong gritted his teeth, his armor groaning under the pressure. He ignited his thrusters, fighting the pull of the core, and began the long climb back to the surface.

When he emerged into the plaza, he was smoking, his armor scarred and his breath coming in ragged gasps. He walked to Nuwa and held out his hand. The Neutron Gem sat in his palm, its light pulsing in sync with his heartbeat.

Nuwa took the stone. She didn't thank him. She simply tossed it into the air, where it was caught by the floating colored spheres. The spheres began to spin faster, their colors merging into a blinding white light that shot into the sky, lighting up the artificial nebulae.

"The search is active," Nuwa said, her voice echoing across the plaza.

"And the Master?" Wukong asked, his voice desperate. "Where is he?"

Nuwa turned to him, her galactic eyes softening for a brief moment. "To find the Master, Wukong, you must first find your original self. The one who existed before the titles, before the rebellion, before the journey. You seek a frequency that you yourself have forgotten."

"What does that mean?" Wukong demanded. "I am Sun Wukong! I am the Great Sage! I am the one who—"

"You are a mask," Nuwa interrupted. "And the Master is lost in the space between the mask and the soul. Find the 'Original Monkey', and you will find the path."

Before Wukong could speak again, Nuwa’s form began to dissolve into a cloud of colorful pixels. The floating spheres vanished, and the plaza went silent.

"Wait!" Wukong shouted, but there was no answer.

He stood alone in the center of the crystalline world, the Resonance Tracker in his hand now silent. The cryptic message felt like a weight heavier than the Neutron Gem. *Find your original self.*

He looked at his reflection in a nearby crystalline spire. He saw the golden armor, the fierce eyes, the legendary staff. But who was he beneath it all?

For the first time in his long life, the Great Sage felt truly lost. He chose to stay on Kunlun, wandering the silent forests of data, hoping that somewhere in the archives of the multiverse, he would find the answer to the riddle of himself.
