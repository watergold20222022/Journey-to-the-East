The *Sky Rake* was no longer just a ship; it was a conduit for enough energy to light a small star. Cables snaked from every bulkhead, feeding into the crude but elegant spire of crystal and steel that Alice and Tianji had erected in the center of the clearing.

"Interface established with ARES-9," Tianji announced. His voice was layered, resonating with the immense data stream pouring into his chassis. "Borrowing processing power from the fleet. We are currently utilizing 94% of the Beast-Man civilization's total computing capacity."

"Don't melt their internet," Bajie grunted, checking the straps on his armor. He looked at the shimmering air in front of the device. "Is it ready?"

"The equation is solved," Alice said, her hands trembling slightly as she adjusted the final emitter. "We're not just breaking a wall, Bajie. We're folding two pieces of paper so they touch. The moment we turn this on, the probability of us existing in Wukong's timeline becomes 100%."

"Do it," Bajie said.

Alice threw the switch.

There was no sound. The universe didn't scream; it sighed. The air in front of them turned inside out. Colors that the human eye—and pig eye—weren't meant to see spiraled into a vortex of absolute black and blinding white.

"Stability holding," Tianji said, stepping into the vortex first. "Follow me."

Bajie didn't hesitate. He grabbed Alice's hand and jumped.

The sensation was like falling upwards through a frozen waterfalls. Memories that weren't his flashed before Bajie's eyes—a world of fire, a monkey born of stone, a long march to the West. Then, with a jarring thud, they hit solid ground.

They were still on Planet Kunlun. But it was different.

The sky was a shade darker. The crystals didn't glow; they were matte and grey. The air felt heavy, burdened with centuries of silence.

"We made it," Alice whispered, checking her scanner. "Chronometric variance is zero. We are in his time."

"Where is he?" Bajie pulled the diary from his belt. It was burning hot. He held it up like a compass. The vibration was violent, pointing due North. "This way!"

They ran. They scrambled over jagged obsidian ridges and slid down slopes of glass gravel. Bajie moved with a speed that belied his bulk, fueled by a desperation that had been building for years.

"Brother!" he roared, his voice echoing off the dead canyon walls. "Sun Wukong!"

Tianji scanned the horizon. "Heat signature detected. Biological. High energy density. 500 meters."

They rounded a massive spire of quartz and skidded to a halt.

There, sitting on a flat rock, legs crossed, tail twitching lazily, was a figure that Bajie had seen in his dreams every night. He wore ragged golden armor, and a red cape that looked like it had been torn by galaxies.

The Monkey King opened his eyes. They were gold, endless, and filled with a spark of mischief that no prison could extinguish.

"You're late," Wukong said, his voice cracking from disuse. "Did you stop for snacks on the way?"

"You—" Bajie choked. He dropped his rake. He stumbled forward, tears streaming down his hog-snout. "You damned ape!"

He crashed into Wukong, wrapping his massive arms around the smaller monkey. Wukong didn't pull away. He sighed, a sound of infinite relief, and patted Bajie on the back.

"I knew you'd come, idiot," Wukong whispered. "I knew it."

They held each other for a long moment, the silence of the dead world finally broken by the sound of brotherhood.

Alice watched, wiping her own eyes. She nudged Tianji. "You getting this?"

"I am recording every micro-expression," Tianji said softly. "It is... highly efficient emotional data."

Bajie finally pulled back, wiping his nose on his sleeve. He turned to the others. "Brother, look. I didn't come alone."

Wukong hopped off the rock, his movement fluid and weightless. He looked at Alice, then at the silver robot.

"A human girl," Wukong said, tilting his head. "And a... metal demon?"

"I am Alice," she said, stepping forward and bowing awkwardly. "I... I read about you. It's an honor, Great Sage."

Wukong grinned, baring his fangs. "You have brave eyes, girl. You brought my idiot brother across the stars. For that, you have my gratitude."

"And I am Tianji," the robot said, bowing with perfect geometric precision. "I am an autonomous artificial intelligence. It was my algorithms that stabilized the quantum bridge."

Wukong walked around the robot, tapping his metallic chest. *Clang. Clang.* "Sturdy. No soul, but plenty of spirit. I like him."

"We're a team," Bajie said proudly, picking up his rake. "We're the new pilgrims, Brother. And we're going to get you out of here."

Wukong looked at them—a pig, a human, and a machine. A strange, impossible group standing at the end of the universe.

He threw his head back and laughed, a sound that shook the crystals around them.

"Good," Wukong said, summoning his Golden Staff to his hand. "Because I'm bored of this rock. Let's go make some noise."
