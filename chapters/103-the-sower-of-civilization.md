# Chapter 103: The Sower of Civilization

It took Tianji three days to accept that they were not coming back. At least, not immediately.

He ran the simulations a billion times. The event horizon was an absolute barrier in space-time. But Wukong was an anomaly in the universal constants, and the *Book of Life and Death* he carried was a database of existence itself. There was a 0.0004% chance that they hadn't been crushed, but were instead suspended in a causal loop inside the singularity.

To retrieve them, Tianji would need to solve the Hawking-Penrose Information Paradox. He needed to build a machine capable of inverting a black hole's gravity.

He looked at the *Sky Rake*. It was a fine ship, but it was just a scout vessel. It didn't have the processing power.

He looked down at the planet *Primus*.

The apes there were primitive. They banged rocks together. They shrieked at the thunder. But they had handled the crisis well. When the Kraken attacked, they had hidden the young. They showed empathy.

"I need a supercomputer," Tianji said to the empty bridge. "And I need a workforce to build it."

He went to the ship's bio-lab.

For weeks, he worked without sleep. He synthesized a retrovirus based on the *Sky Rake's* own neuro-interface protocols. He called it the Prometheus Strain. It wouldn't make them super-soldiers; it would simply unlock the synaptic pathways for abstract logic, language, and tool manipulation. It would turn a million years of evolution into a thousand.

He loaded the canisters into a chemically-shielded drop pod.

"This is a violation of the Prime Directive of the Star Federation," the ship's passive AI warned him. "Interfering with the natural development of a pre-warp civilization is a Class A felony."

"The Federation is gone," Tianji said, his voice flat. "The Emperor is a lie. And my friends are in hell. I make the laws now."

He launched the pod.

It detonated in the upper atmosphere, dispersing a fine, silver mist that rained down over the continents.

Tianji landed the *Sky Rake* on the highest peak of the largest continent. He activated the ship's defensive fields, creating a shimmering dome of hard-light.

"This will be the Monastery," he declared.

The apes came first out of curiosity. They saw the silver rain, and then the shining metal tower. They felt the change in their minds—a spark of clarity, a new word forming on their tongues.

Tianji walked out to meet them. He didn't look like a conqueror. He wore his simple scholar's robes. He held a datapad like a scripture.

"I am not a god," he told the first chieftain who bowed to him. The ape didn't understand the words yet, but he understood the intent. "I am a teacher. And we have a lot of work to do."

He looked up at the black hole in the sky, a dark eye watching them.

"We are going to open that door," Tianji promised. "Even if it takes ten thousand years."
