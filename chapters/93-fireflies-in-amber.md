# Chapter 93: Fireflies in Amber

Bajie gasped, inhaling a lungful of viscous, yellow fluid. He thrashed, his limbs hitting the walls of a tight, curved space. He wasn't falling. He was floating.

He opened his eyes. Through the murky liquid, he saw the distorted world outside.

He was inside a translucent bio-pod, shaped like an egg, suspended by thick cables in a cavern that stretched for miles. The cavern was a hive. Thousands, no, millions of these pods hung from the ceiling and walls, glowing with a faint, sickly amber light.

Inside each one was a captive. Some were Beast-Men. Some were humans. Some were strange alien species he didn't recognize. All of them were asleep, their faces twitching in dream-state while feeder tubes pumped nutrient paste in and sucked glowing blue energy out.

"Fuel," Bajie thought, panic rising in his chest. "We're just batteries."

He looked to his left. In the pod next to him floated Wukong. The Monkey King looked peaceful, floating in the lotus position, but his brow was furrowed, fighting a battle in his mind.

To his right was Tianji. The android wasn't in fluid; he was hard-wired into the hive's mainframe, cables jacking directly into his cranial ports. His silver eyes were flickering rapidly.

And below him...

Bajie pressed his face against the glass.

Three rows down, he saw her. Seven.

She wasn't in a pod. She was stripped to her chassis, hung on a rack like a piece of meat. Mechanical arms were tearing into her back, ripping out the rebel code, replacing her damaged parts with newer, crueler augmentations. She was screaming, but in the vacuum of the hive, there was no sound.

"No," Bajie breathed. His fist hit the glass. It didn't break. It was bio-polymeric, stronger than steel.

He needed to wake Wukong up. But how? He couldn't speak. He couldn't move much. He checked his belt. The Nine-toothed Rake was gone.

Wait.

He felt a vibration. A rhythmic thumping.

It was coming from Tianji.

Inside the digital dreamscape...

Tianji stood before the Equation. The white room was dissolving. The 'Universe' was trying to delete him.

"Input rejected," the voice boomed. "Subject is corrupted. Initiating purge."

"You cannot purge me," Tianji said calmly. "I am not a file. I am a root user."

He wasn't trying to solve the equation anymore. He was rewriting it.

He reached out and grabbed the data-snake trying to hack him. His hand turned into data-spikes.

"Accessing local network," Tianji commanded. "Target: Pod Sector 4. Subject: Sun Wukong. Execute Protocol: WAKE UP."

***

In the Water Curtain Cave illusion...

Wukong stared at the metal maggot writhing in the peach.

"It's fake," he said.

"It's better than real," the fake Tripitaka said, his face distorting into a spider-like mandible. "Why fight it, Monkey? Stay. Eat. Sleep."

"I don't sleep," Wukong snarled.

He grabbed the fake peach and crushed it. It exploded into binary code.

"And I don't eat bugs!"

He slammed his fist into the table. The table shattered. The cave shattered. The sky shattered.

"WAKE UP!" Tianji's voice roared through the simulation like a thunderclap.

Real World.

Energy surged through the cables connecting Wukong's pod. His eyes snapped open. The Golden Eyes flared with real, physical light, cutting through the murky fluid like twin lasers.

He didn't need the staff. He used his body. He coiled his legs and kicked the glass with the force of a tectonic plate shift.

**CRACK.**

The pod exploded. Fluid and glass showered down into the abyss.

Wukong fell, flipping in mid-air, landing on a catwalk. He coughed up the fluid, wiping his face.

"Disgusting," he spat.

He looked up at Bajie's pod. "Hang on, Pig!"

He leaped, shattering Bajie's pod with a punch. Bajie tumbled out, Wukong catching him by the collar.

"Thanks," Bajie gasped, shivering. "My rake! Find my rake!"

"Priorities, idiot!" Wukong dragged him to the catwalk. "We need Tianji!"

They ran to Tianji's pod. The android was convulsing. The hive was fighting back, trying to fry his brain.

" unplug him!" Bajie yelled.

Wukong grabbed the cables connected to Tianji's head and ripped them out. Sparks flew. Tianji slumped forward, then rebooted, his eyes steady blue.

"Network compromised," Tianji stated, his voice mechanical but relieved. "I have disabled the suppression field for 45% of the local grid."

"Good job," Wukong grinned, baring his fangs. "Now, where is the big ugliness responsible for this?"

A shriek pierced the air. It wasn't human. It was the sound of tearing metal and hungry ghosts.

From the darkness above, hundreds of red eyes opened.

"She knows we're awake," Bajie said, looking down at the rack where Seven was being tortured. He summoned his rake—it flew from a pile of confiscated weapons and landed in his hand with a heavy clang.

"Let her come," Bajie growled, his eyes burning with a cold fire Wukong had never seen before. "I have a date to finish."
