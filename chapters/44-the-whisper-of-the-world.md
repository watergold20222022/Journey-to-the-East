# Chapter 44: The Whisper of the World

Tang Seng sat at the base of the World Tree, a speck of red and gold against the endless wall of ancient bark. He had been chanting for hours, his voice a low hum that vibrated in his chest, but the great mind of the planet remained a distant, impenetrable ocean.

"Analysis," Tang Seng murmured, his eyes still closed. "Why does it not answer? I feel the life flowing, but it flows *past* me, not *to* me."

Sentry-7 monitored the biometrics displayed on its internal HUD. "Guest, the discrepancy is temporal. The Mother Tree processes information at a geological speed. Your neural impulses are like the buzzing of a fly—too fast, too fleeting to be registered as conversation."

"So I am too small and too fast," Tang Seng noted. "How do I slow down?"

"You cannot biologicaly decelerate your synaptic firings to that degree without ceasing life functions," Sentry-7 explained. "However, I can act as a buffer."

The robot stepped forward, kneeling beside the monk. It extended a cable from its wrist, plugging it into a data port on the back of Tang Seng's nanosuit. Then, it placed its other hand directly onto the mossy surface of the Mother Tree, extruding fine data-filaments that burrowed into the bark.

"I will record your intent," Sentry words appeared in Tang Seng's mind, a direct digital thought. "I will buffer it, loop it, and transmit it at a frequency matching the Tree's circadian rhythm. I will be your translator."

Tang Seng took a deep breath. "Then let us speak."

He focused his mind on a single image: Sun Wukong. The Golden Cudgel. The fiery eyes. The chaotic, boundless energy of the Monkey King. He poured his worry, his love, and his desperate need to find his disciple into the thought.

*Where is he?*

Sentry-7 absorbed the thought. The robot’s cooling fans whirred to maximum as it began the translation process. It didn't just ask the question; it encoded the question into a packet of slow-moving bio-data, simulating the growth of a season, the turning of a year.

Minutes passed. Then hours. To the Tree, it was perhaps a split second of attention.

Suddenly, the ground beneath them lurched.

It wasn't an earthquake. It was a sigh.

A vision flooded Tang Seng’s mind. It wasn't visual—it was sensory. He felt the weight of mountains, the flow of rivers, the itch of a million insects crawling on skin. He felt the sun on leaves on the other side of the planet.

Then, the static cleared. The Tree was looking at him.

*< FOREIGN SEED >*

The voice was not a sound, but a tectonic plate shifting in his brain.

*< YOU SEEK THE FIRE-APE. >*

"Yes!" Tang Seng cried out in his mind. "My disciple! Is he here?"

The Tree's consciousness shifted, scanning its vast memory banks of root and leaf.

*< THE FIRE-APE IS NOT OF THIS SOIL. HIS ROOT IS CUT. >*

Tang Seng’s heart sank. "He is not... on this planet?"

*< THE ONE YOU SEEK IS ABSENT. BUT... >*

The vision shifted. Tang Seng saw a valley, far to the South. It was a desolate place, scarred by jagged rocks and swirling mists. In the center of the valley, there was a pulse. A rhythmic, angry throbbing of energy that felt familiar. It tasted like ash and lightning.

*< THE ECHO OF THE SPECIES EXISTS. A MEMORY OF THE FIRE-APE. IT SCREAMS IN THE STONE VALLEY. >*

"An echo?" Tang Seng asked. "What does that mean?"

*< IT IS KINDRED. BUT IT IS BROKEN. IT WAITS. >*

The connection snapped.

Tang Seng gasped, falling forward onto his hands. Sentry-7 retracted its cables, steam rising from its joints.

"System overheat," Sentry reported, its voice static-filled. "The data transfer... exceeded safety parameters by 400%."

Tang Seng scrambled up, supporting the robot. "Are you alright?"

"Functional," Sentry confirmed, stabilizing. "Did we receive an answer?"

"Not Wukong," Tang Seng said, his eyes wide. "But something like him. An 'echo'. The Tree showed me a valley to the South. It said a memory of the Fire-Ape screams there."

Ao Lie, who had been guarding them, stepped closer. "A memory? Could it be another version of Eldest Brother? From a different timeline?"

"Or a trap," Sentry suggested logically. "But it is the only anomaly the global scanner has confirmed."

Tang Seng looked South. The vision of the scarred valley was burned into his mind. It felt dangerous, angry, and sad.

"If it is him, or a part of him, or even a shadow of him," Tang Seng said, clutching his staff, "I have to know."

He turned to his companions. "We go South. To the Stone Valley."
