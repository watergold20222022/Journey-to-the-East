The Badlands, a desolate stretch of rocky terrain north of the Metropolis, was usually quiet. It was a dumping ground for industrial waste and failed experiments, a place where the smog hung low and heavy. But today, the sensors on Zhu Bajie's "Iron Tusk" mech were screaming.

"Contact front!" Alice's voice crackled over the comms. Her scout mech, lighter and faster than Bajie's, was perched on a ridge five hundred meters ahead. "Three bogeys. No transponder signals. They don't match any known Beast-Man configuration."

Bajie adjusted the grip on his controls. "Tybalt, flank left. I'll take the center."

"Copy that," the Tiger-Man growled. His mech, customized with serrated blades on the arms, moved with a predatory grace through the debris.

The targets emerged from the smog. They were sleek, floating drones, shaped like teardrops of liquid mercury. They had no visible weapons, no cockpits, and they moved with an eerie, silent fluidity that defied gravity.

"Identify yourselves!" Bajie boomed through his external speakers.

The response was a beam of coherent light that sliced through the rock next to Bajie's mech, turning granite into molten slag.

"Hostile! Definitely hostile!" Alice yelled, opening fire with her sniper railgun. The round, traveling at hypersonic speed, sparked off the lead drone's hull but didn't penetrate. It seemed to ripple, absorbing the impact.

"Shields!" Tybalt shouted. "They have energy shields!"

The drones returned fire, not with lasers, but with pulses of concussive force that knocked Tybalt's mech off its feet. The Tiger-Man roared in frustration as his systems flickered.

"They're too fast for the targeting computers!" Alice cried, dodging a strafing run.

Bajie narrowed his eyes. He felt the familiar surge of adrenaline, the old warrior spirit waking up beneath layers of cynicism and pig fat. These machines moved like spirits, not metal.

"Forget the computers," Bajie grunted. He disengaged the auto-targeting system. "Manual control."

He pushed his mech's throttle to the red line. The Iron Tusk groaned, its joints protesting the sudden acceleration. Bajie didn't shoot; he charged.

The lead drone paused, calculating the trajectory of the clumsy walker. It prepared to fire.

That was its mistake.

Bajie triggered the jump jets—a modification he had "persuaded" the mechanics to install against regulations. The heavy mech launched into the air, defying physics with brute force. In mid-air, Bajie swung the mech's massive plasma cannon not as a gun, but as a club.

*CRUNCH.*

The impact was deafening. The drone's shield shattered under the sheer kinetic force of fifty tons of steel. The mercury hull crumpled, and the machine spiraled into the ground, exploding in a shower of blue sparks.

"One down!" Bajie shouted. He landed, the ground shaking, and immediately spun to face the second drone. "Come and get some, you scrap heaps!"

The remaining two drones coordinated their attack, flanking him. But Bajie was already moving. He used the momentum of his landing to pivot, firing a point-blank plasma burst into the second drone before it could realign. The third drone, sensing the threat, tried to retreat, but Tybalt had recovered. He leaped from the shadows, his mech's blades tearing through the drone's propulsion drive.

Alice finished it off with a precise shot to its exposed core.

Silence returned to the Badlands, save for the crackle of burning metal.

The return to base was a spectacle. The wreckage of the drones was hauled in on flatbed trucks, covered in tarps, but word had already spread. The "Alien Vanguard," they called it. Proof that the invasion had begun.

But more importantly, word spread of the pig-man who had clubbed a high-tech killing machine out of the sky.

Bajie, Alice, and Tybalt were summoned to the command spire of the Planetary Defense Headquarters. The room was vast, overlooking the entire military complex.

"At ease," a deep, rumbling voice commanded.

Bajie looked up. Standing behind a massive obsidian desk was the Minister of Defense, General Rakafa.

He was a Minotaur. A towering figure of muscle and fur, with curved horns that spanned a meter wide. He wore a uniform adorned with medals, but his presence was raw, primal power. His eyes were dark and intelligent, assessing them with a heavy gaze.

Bajie felt a jolt of recognition. The broad nose, the heavy brow, the sheer aura of dominance. He looked remarkably like the Bull Demon King, Bajie's sworn brother and occasional enemy from the old life.

"You are the ones who engaged the scouts," Rakafa said, stepping forward. His hooves clacked on the polished floor. "Report."

"They were fast, sir," Alice said, standing at attention. "Adaptive shielding. Kinetic dampeners. Tech level is... centuries ahead of us."

"And yet," Rakafa turned his gaze to Bajie, "you destroyed them. With a standard-issue walker."

"The walker is sturdy," Bajie said, meeting the Minotaur's gaze. "But a weapon is only as good as the hand that wields it."

Rakafa snorted, a puff of steam escaping his nostrils. A smile, grim but approving, tugged at his lips. "Well said. Our analysts are already dissecting the wreckage. It confirms our fears. The Creators are testing our defenses. These were automated probes."

He walked around the desk and placed a heavy hand on Bajie's shoulder.

"We need warriors like you, Zhu Bajie. Soldiers who don't just follow protocols but know how to fight when the protocols fail."

Rakafa picked up a datapad. "Effective immediately, you are promoted to Captain. You will lead the newly formed 'Special Operations Unit 8'. Your friends here will be your lieutenants. You will have access to the best gear we have. Your mission is simple: Find where these things are landing, and destroy them before they can establish a beachhead."

"Captain," Bajie repeated, testing the word. It wasn't 'Marshal', but it was a start.

"Do not disappoint me, Captain," Rakafa said, his voice dropping to a low rumble that vibrated in Bajie's chest. "The fate of our species may rest on your shoulders."

As they left the office, Bajie glanced back at the Minotaur General. Rakafa was staring out the window at the sky, his silhouette framed against the gathering storm clouds.

"He reminds me of someone," Bajie muttered to himself.

"Who?" Alice asked.

"An old friend," Bajie said, a small, nostalgic smile touching his lips. "A very stubborn, very powerful old friend. If this Rakafa is half the warrior he was, we might actually stand a chance."
