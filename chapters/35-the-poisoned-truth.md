# Chapter 35: The Poisoned Truth

The silence in the White Bone Throne Room was heavy, broken only by the crackle of sparks from severed cables and the ragged breathing of the defeated queen. Baigujing lay slumped against the dais of her shattered throne, her nanoskin flickering between a pristine alabaster simulation and the charred, skeletal chassis beneath.

Wukong retracted the Ruyi Jingu Bang, allowing it to hover magnetically at his back. He stepped over the debris of the destroyed skeletal guards, his optical sensors scanning the room. The signal he had been tracking—the faint, golden bio-signature of his Master—was stronger here. It was pulsing from somewhere behind the throne.

"Enough games," Wukong growled, his voice amplified by his external speakers. "Where is he? My sibling, Sha Wujing, said you kept him. Where is the Master of this timeline?"

Bajie, his armor dented and smoking from the battle, stepped up beside Wukong. He looked around nervously, his rake held ready. "Yeah, witch. Hand over the Monk. If he's still alive, maybe we didn't fail this timeline completely."

Sha Wujing, still cradling his head in madness but currently lucid, looked up from the floor. His eyes were wide with a desperate hope. "Master... Master is here? I can... I can smell incense. The smell of the temple."

Baigujing let out a laugh. It was a dry, hacking sound, like grinding gears. "Rescue him?" she rasped. "You want to *rescue* the Tang Monk?"

"We sensed his aura," Wukong said, stepping closer. "Don't try to lie. My sensors don't make mistakes."

"Your sensors..." She coughed, leaking a dark, viscous hydraulic fluid from her mouth. "Your sensors detect his resonance. His... divine frequency."

She raised a trembling, skeletal hand and pointed to a reliquary behind the throne. It was a containment unit made of transparent poly-glass, lit from within by a soft, golden light.

"Go on," she whispered. "Meet your Master."

Wukong moved instantly, a blur of motion. He reached the containment unit and wiped the frost from the glass. Bajie crowded in behind him.

"Master!" Bajie called out. "We're here to—"

The words died in his throat.

Inside the glass case, there was no living monk. There was no "Blood Bag" connected to life support machines.

Resting on a velvet cushion was a pile of white bones. They were immaculately clean, polished to a shine. draped over them was the tattered, moth-eaten remains of the Kasaya—the red and gold frock of the Buddhist sanctity. The golden aura Wukong had sensed was radiating from the bones themselves, a ghostly half-life that refused to fade.

Wukong stared, his processor struggling to reconcile the data. "This... this is impossible."

"He is dead," Baigujing said, her voice dripping with mockery. "Long dead. I ate him. Every morsel. Every drop of holy blood."

Wukong spun around, his eyes blazing red. He grabbed Baigujing by her throat plating and slammed her against the dais. "You lie! If you ate the Tang Monk—if you consumed the flesh of the Golden Cicada—you would be immortal! You would be a god! But look at you. You are weak. Your reaction times were slow. Your shield generators were obsolete. You fell to us like a common thug!"

This was the question that had plagued Wukong during the fight. Baigujing was legendary. In his own timeline, she was a terrifying sorceress. Here, she was the ruler of the North. Yet, her combat performance had been underwhelming. She relied heavily on her tech and her army, but her own personal power—her *mana*—felt hollow.

Baigujing did not struggle. Instead, a twisted smile spread across her face.

"Immortal?" She spat the word out like a curse. "That is what they told us, isn't it? The legend spread through the darknet, whispered in the shadow servers. *Eat a piece of the Tang Monk's flesh, and live forever. Gain ultimate power.*"

She looked past Wukong, staring at the bones in the glass case.

"I believed it," she whispered. "After I killed that fool of a Monkey in this world... after I broke the Pig and enslaved the Sandy one... I had the prize. I feasted. I thought I would ascend. I thought I would become the ruler of the galaxy."

"And?" Tianji asked, stepping forward, her datapad recording the confession. "Physiologically, the consumption of high-energy biomass should have enhanced your systems."

"It was poison," Baigujing hissed.

The room went silent. Even the wind howling outside the spire seemed to pause.

"Poison?" Bajie asked, blinking.

"Tech-rot," Baigujing explained, her voice bitter. "Viral code woven into his very DNA. A biological trap. The moment I digested his flesh, it didn't give me immortality. It attacked my core. It burned through my magic circuits. It locked away my higher functions."

She looked at Wukong with eyes full of hate. "Why do you think I sat on this frozen throne for centuries, doing nothing but building skeletons? I wasn't ruling. I was *dying*. I was trying to purge the toxins from my system. The Monk's flesh... it stripped me of my magic. It left me a cripple."

She laughed again, a sound of pure despair. "The Golden Cicada... was a trojan horse."

Wukong released her, stepping back as if burned. He looked at the pile of bones. The radiation coming from them felt diferent now—not holy, but warning.

"A lie?" Wukong muttered. The core of his programming, the mission statement he had rebooted with, trembled. "The Journey to the West... the quest for the Sutras... the promise of enlightenment... all of it?"

"Why would the Buddha send a poison vessel across the world?" Bajie asked, his voice shaking. "Unless... unless they wanted the demons to eat him. Unless the whole journey was a pest control operation. A trap to lure us out and kill us."

"Or," Tianji suggested, her voice analytical but laced with concern, "the 'immortality' rumor was a fabrication to test the Monk's protectors. But if the flesh itself is toxic... that implies a level of cruelty in the system design that contradicts the doctrinal parameters."

Wukong looked at the Kasaya draping the bones. He remembered his own Master, back in Timeline A. He remembered the nagging loyalty, the frustration, the bond.

"If this is true," Wukong said, his voice low and dangerous, "then the Master of this world died for nothing. And my alternate self died defending a lie."

"He was delicious, though," Baigujing sneered, trying to regain some shred of dignity. "A little bitter at the end."

Wukong didn't look at her. He looked at Sha Wujing. The River Demon was staring at the bones, weeping silently.

"Master is dead," Sha Wujing whimpered. "Mission failed. Mission failed. Server reset required."

"No reset," Wukong said softly. "There is no reset for them."

He turned back to Baigujing. The revelation hung in the air—a dark cloud over the entire concept of their existence. If the prize was poison, what was the destination? What were the Sutras?

"You say you lost your magic," Wukong said. "That is why you feared the Staff. You feared that if the real Sun Wukong returned, in your weakened state, you would be instantly annihilated."

"I feared judgment," Baigujing admitted. "And now it is here."

Wukong looked at the bones one last time. "Bajie, collect the Master's remains. We will not leave him here as a trophy."

"Right, Brother," Bajie said, his usual joking demeanor gone. He moved solemnly to the case.

Wukong walked to the edge of the shattered window, looking out over the frozen wasteland of the North. The wind whipped at his face. Somewhere out there was the path they were supposed to take. But now, the path looked less like a road to salvation, and more like a slaughterhouse chute.

"A lie," Wukong repeated to himself. "Or a weapon."

He gripped his staff tight.

"If the West is a trap," he vowed to the cold wind, "then I will tear down the sky before I let my Master step into it."
