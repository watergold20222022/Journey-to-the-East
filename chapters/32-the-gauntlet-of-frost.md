"Watch him," Wukong said, placing a hand on Alice's shoulder. "If he wakes up screaming, don't try to fight him. Just sedate him again."

Alice nodded, checking the charge on her med-gun. She sat next to the unconscious Sha Seng, who was wrapped in thermal blankets inside the *Sky Rake's* warmth. "You just make sure you come back. I'm not flying this ship alone."

"We'll be back," Bajie grunted, checking the seals on his armor. "And we'll bring the Master."

The airlock hissed open, and the freezing wind of the Northern Wastes howled like a banshee. Wukong, Bajie, and Tianji stepped out into the white blinded world.

"Target is 12 kilometers North-North-East," Tianji announced, his voice synthesizing over the wind. "The Spire of Eternal Grief. I am detecting a massive concentration of necrotic energy."

"And the staff," Wukong added, his eyes glowing gold beneath his visor. "It's calling to me. It's angry."

They hadn't walked five hundred meters before the ice began to tremble.

"Here we go," Bajie muttered, gripping his Nine-Toothed Rake.

The snowdrifts ahead erupted. This time, it wasn't animals. It was the skeletons of animals. Massive, reanimated ribcages of whales and leviathans, knit together with green sorcery and ice, forming centipede-like horrors that skittered across the glacier.

"Bone Crawlers!" Wukong yelled. "Don't let them surround us!"

He didn't wait. He leaped forward, his Golden Staff extending to fifty feet in mid-air. He brought it down like a hammer of god, shattering the spine of the lead crawler. Bone shards and green slime sprayed into the wind.

"Clean up on aisle three!" Bajie roared, charging the left flank. A crawler lunged at him, itsmandibles dripping with acid. Bajie didn't dodge. He caught the creature's jaws with the teeth of his rake and *heaved*. With a grunt of exertion, he flipped the ten-ton monstrosity onto its back, exposing its glowing green core.

"Tianji!" Bajie shouted.

"Target acquired," the robot replied. A plasma cannon deployed from his shoulder. *THOOM.* A bolt of superheated blue energy struck the exposed core, vaporizing the magic holding the bones together. The creature collapsed into a pile of lifeless calcium.

But there were more. Dozens more. They poured over the ridges of the glacier, a tide of white bone against white snow.

"Keep moving!" Wukong ordered, spinning his staff into a propeller that deflected a spray of acid. "If we stop, we freeze! Push through!"

They became a wedge of destruction. Wukong was the tip, a golden blur that smashed everything in his path. Bajie was the shield, using his massive bulk and rake to sweep enemies aside. Tianji was the scalpel, picking off flankers with surgical precision energy blasts.

The battles didn't stop. They merged into one long, exhausting slog.

At kilometer four, they fought "Ice Golems"—hulking humanoids made of compressed glacier ice, animated by the souls of the frozen dead. Wukong shattered them, but they kept reforming.

"Fire!" Wukong realized. "Tianji, burn them!"

The robot switched to a flamethrower, turning the ice to steam. Wukong used the cover of the fog to slip behind the largest golem, driving his staff into the rune carved on its back.

At kilometer eight, the sky darkened. "Valkyrie Harpies"—skeletal birds with women's faces—dove from the clouds, screaming curses that lowered the body temperature of anyone who heard them.

"Shut up!" Bajie bellowed. He activated the jet-boosters on his armor—a modification from the Kara Defense Force—and launched himself into the air. He caught a harpy by its bony legs and used it as a flail to knock two others out of the sky.

Through it all, the signal in Wukong's mind grew louder. It wasn't just the metal of the staff calling; it was a heartbeat. Faint, slow, but there.

*Thump... thump...*

"The Master," Wukong whispered, smashing a skeleton into dust. "He's alive."

The thought gave him a burst of strength. He roared, a sound that shook snow from the mountains peaks.

"Baigujing!" Wukong screamed at the storm. "Send everything you have! It won't be enough!"

They crested the final ridge. Below them, in the center of a crater that looked like a wound in the world, stood the Spire.

It was a tower of white bone, fused together into a smooth, organic porcelain. It spiraled up into the storm clouds, pulsating with a sickly green light. And impaled at the very top, acting as a lightning rod for the dark energy, was the silhouette of a Golden Staff.

"We're here," Tianji said, his chassis covered in frost and scorch marks.

"Let's knock it down," Bajie growled.

"No," Wukong said, staring at the base of the tower. "We don't knock. We kick the door in."
