# Chapter 86: The Spar on Crateris

The rescue ships were gone. The moon was silent.

Nezha stood up, dusting the lunar regolith from his battle trousers. He tossed the empty wine bottle into a crater. It floated away in the low gravity, spinning slowly.

"Playtime is over," Nezha said. His voice was different. Heavier. The 'Teacher' was gone; the Marshal of the Central Altar was back.

Red Boy didn't look surprised. He stood up too, stretching his arms. "I was wondering when the badge would come back on."

"I am an officer of the Heavenly Court," Nezha summoned his Fire-tipped Spear. The metal hummed, cold and deadly. "You are a fugitive. A demon. An escapee from the Eternal Hell."

"I am," Red Boy agreed. He ignited his hands. One burned with True Samadhi Fire, the other with the black cold of the Void. "And you are the guy who helped me build a robot army."

"That was... community service," Nezha leveled his spear. "This is duty. Surrender, Red Boy. I can promise you a fair trial. Maybe even a reduced sentence."

Red Boy laughed. "There are no trials for people like me, Third Prince. Only cages."

"Then I have to bring you in," Nezha ignited his wheels. "Dead or alive."

"Alive is harder," Red Boy smirked. "Let's see if you're up to it."

They clashed.

It wasn't like their first fight in space. That had been a brawl. This was a dance.

Nezha lunged, a flurry of thrusts that moved faster than light. Red Boy dodged, weaving through the attacks like smoke. They knew each other's moves now. They had spent weeks watching each other fight.

Nezha feinted with the spear, then swung the Universe Ring. Red Boy didn't block; he caught the ring's momentum with a gravity well, spinning around it to deliver a kick to Nezha’s chest.

Nezha took the hit, skidding back across the grey dust. He grinned.

"You're faster," Nezha noted. "The healing did you good."

"You're pulling your punches," Red Boy countered, hovering in the air. "That strike should have taken my head off."

"I'm trying to arrest you, not erase you," Nezha shot back. "Three Heads, Six Arms!"

He transformed. But instead of the usual overwhelming barrage, he used the extra limbs to grapple. He was trying to pin Red Boy, to immobilize him.

Red Boy realized the game. Nezha didn't want to win. He wanted to try to win, and fail.

"You are too noble for this job," Red Boy whispered.

He gathered the Void energy in his chest. *Samadhi Void: Repulsion.*

He didn't aim it at Nezha. He aimed it at the ground between them.

**BOOM.**

The moonquack shattered the crust. A massive cloud of dust and debris exploded upward, blinding the sensors.

Nezha shielded his eyes. "Cheap trick!"

"Effective!" Red Boy's voice came from everywhere and nowhere.

Nezha sliced through the dust cloud, scanning for a target. But the thermal signature was gone.

"He warped," Nezha realized.

He looked up. Far above, a streak of red light was accelerating away from the moon, heading toward the galactic rim.

"Nezha!" Red Boy's voice crackled over the comms one last time. "Fix your aim! Next time we meet, I won't go easy on you!"

Nezha lowered his spear. He watched the red streak disappear into the stars.

He could have chased him. His wheels were faster than Red Boy’s flight. He could have shot him down.

Instead, he deactivated his combat mode.

"Brat," Nezha muttered, a small smile playing on his lips. "You better not get caught by anyone else."

He tapped his comms link. "Central Command. This is Marshal Nezha. Suspect... escaped. Pursuit failed. Returning to base for debrief."

He looked back at the planet below, where the children were safe.

"Mission accomplished," he whispered to himself.
