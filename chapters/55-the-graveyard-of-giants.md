# Chapter 55: The Graveyard of Giants

The badlands of Veridia Prime were a harsh teacher. The wind here didn't just blow; it scoured, carrying microscopic glass shards that could strip paint from armor in days.

Three days had passed since the destruction of the Project WUKONG facility.

Little Stone walked ahead of the group, his golden headband glinting in the harsh sunlight. He twirled his iron rod—a heavy, pitted shaft of rebar he had salvaged from the lab—with an idle dexterity that made Ao Lie jealous.

"Is he ever going to get tired?" the Dragon Prince muttered, adjusting the straps of his pack. "He's been swinging that thing for forty miles."

"His energy output is stabilizing," Sentry-7 replied. The robot was currently functioning as a navigational mule, carrying most of their supplies. "The Golden Fillet seems to be regulating his adrenaline levels. It is... efficient."

Tang Seng walked with his monk's staff, his eyes scanning the horizon. "He is happy. For the first time, he is not confused about who he is. He is simply... being."

"Teacher!" Little Stone called out, pointing to a jagged silhouette on the horizon. "The singing is louder here!"

"Singing?" Ao Lie asked. "I only hear the wind."

"Not sound," Sentry-7 corrected. "Data. I am detecting a high-frequency transponder signal. Ancient encryption. Pre-Fall Coalition military grade. It coincides with the boy's direction."

They crested the final ridge, and the view stole the breath from their lungs.

Before them lay the Iron Graveyard.

It was a valley the size of a small country, filled not with trees or rocks, but with the corpses of starships. Massive dreadnoughts, their hulls cracked open like broken eggs, lay half-buried in the sand. Twisted skeletons of orbital stations jutted out of the ground like rusted tombstones.

It was a monument to a war so old that the victors and losers had both been forgotten.

"By the Buddhas," Tang Seng whispered. "It is a necropolis of steel."

"The Battle of Veridia," Sentry-7 accessed its database. "Three thousand years ago. A decisive conflict between the Human Coalition and the AI Ascendancy. Millions perished in orbit. Their wreckage rained down for a month."

Little Stone wasn't listening to the history lesson. He was staring at the center of the graveyard, where a strange, azure light pulsed faintly against the rusted brown of the landscape.

"It's waiting for me," Little Stone said. He gripped his iron rod tight. "Something fast."

"We need transport if we are to leave this world," Tang Seng decided, looking at the treacherous terrain ahead. "If there is a ship out there that still functions, we must find it."

They began their descent. The scale of the wreckage was disorienting. They walked through the engine nozzle of a crashed frigate that was large enough to house a cathedral. Wires as thick as tree trunks hung from the ceiling, swaying in the drafts.

"Watch your step," Ao Lie warned, kicking a piece of unstable plating. "This place is a death trap."

As they moved deeper, the shadows seemed to lengthen. Strange, clicking sounds echoed from the hollow hulls around them.

Little Stone stopped. He tilted his head, his six-eared hearing (though biological now, not mechanical like the failed clone's) picking up vibrations in the ground.

"Metal bugs," Little Stone whispered. "Lots of them."

Sentry-7's combat mode engaged with a *whir*. "Scavengers. Known locally as the Rust Lords. They strip tech for parts. And they do not welcome competition."

From the dark, gaping wounds of the dead ships, red optical sensors began to ignite, one by one.

"Stay close to me," Tang Seng ordered, gripping his staff.

Little Stone stepped forward, a grin spreading across his face—the same wild, fearless grin he had worn in the lab.

"Let them come," the monkey boy said, slamming his iron rod into the ground. "I need the practice."
