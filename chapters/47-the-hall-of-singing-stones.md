# Chapter 47: The Hall of Singing Stones

Before they took a single step into the scorched maw of the cave, Sentry-7 raised a hand. The panel on its ceramic forearm slid open, and a small, disc-shaped drone buzzed into the air.

"Reconnaissance first," Sentry stated. "If the radiation is lethal, better to lose a sensor unit than a Guest."

Tang Seng watched anxiously as the drone disappeared into the darkness. On Sentry's chest display, a grainy video feed flickered to life. The tunnel was long and jagged, spiraling downward. The walls weren't just stone; they were embedded with veins of glowing ore that pulsed erratically.

Suddenly, the feed distorted. Static washed over the screen, and a high-pitched screech erupted from Sentry's speakers.

"Signal lost," Sentry reported calmly, though its optical eye narrowed. "The drone did not impact an obstacle. It was dismantled by a localized energy surge. The atmospheric ionization inside is equivalent to a solar flare."

The robot turned to Tang Seng. "Your nano-Kasaya is insufficient. Proceeding without Class-A shielding is suicide."

Sentry placed its hands on Tang Seng’s shoulders. The nanosuit shimmered, and a second layer materialized over it—a translucent, blue force field that hummed with a low electric charge. "Ion-shield active. Stay within three meters of me. Do not touch the walls."

Ao Lie drew his sword, its silver light cutting through the gloom. "I will take point. Master, stay behind Sentry."

They entered the cave.

The heat was immediate, a dry, suffocating warmth that pressed against the ion-shield. But as they descended deeper, the tunnel opened up into a cavern so vast that the ceiling was lost in shadow.

It was breathtaking.

The space was filled with crystals of every immense size and color. There were stalagmites of ruby-red quartz, boulders of sapphire, and jagged clusters of emerald that glowed with their own internal light. It looked like a dragon's hoard, or the jewelry box of a god spilled out into the earth.

But it was not silent.

A sound echoed through the chamber—a low, mournful wail that rose and fell like a gale wind in a canyon. But it wasn't wind.

*...Master...*

Tang Seng froze. "Did you hear that?"

*...Why...*

The sound bounced off the walls, multiplying, distorting.

*...Burn... It burns...*

"Wukong?" Tang Seng shouted, his voice caught in his throat. He spun around, scanning the forest of crystals. "Wukong, where are you?"

There was no monkey. No golden armor. No staff.

But the air itself was alive. Tang Seng watched in horror as a spark of golden energy leaped from a large amethyst to a cluster of obsidian. The energy didn't just move; it flowed like blood through veins, jumping between the stones.

As the energy hit a red crystal, the crystal vibrated, emitting a shrill scream of rage.
As it moved to a blue stone, the sound changed to a sob of despair.

"He is not... he is not here," Ao Lie whispered, his face pale, his sword hand trembling. "Master, look. The stones. They are singing."

"This is not singing," Sentry-7 corrected, its sensors working overdrive. "This is storage. These crystalline lattice structures are piezoelectric. They are trapping high-frequency psionic energy and re-playing it. Like a recording loop."

Tang Seng walked toward a massive, jagged pillar of gold stone in the center. The energy swirling around it was thick, suffocating. He could feel the familiar presence of his disciple—the heat, the pride, the stubbornness—but it was shattered, fragmented into a thousand screaming pieces.

"It is his Qi," Tang Seng wept, reaching out but stopped by the shield. "But where is his body?"

*...Alone...* the stones wept. *...Trapped in the reflection...*

The sorrow in the cave was tangible. It wasn't just noise; it was a psychic weight that pressed down on their minds. It was the sound of a hero who had been left behind, left to scream into the dark for eternity.

"Someone trapped his energy here," Ao Lie hissed, looking around the empty hall. "Did he die here? Is this... his grave?"

"No," Tang Seng said, wiping his eyes. He listened closely to the dissonance. Amidst the pain and the anger, there was something else. A rhythm. "A grave is silent. This... this feels like a prison."

He looked up at the kaleidoscope of glowing misery. The echo of the Monkey King was bouncing off the walls, unable to escape, growing more distorted with every pass.

"We have to let him out," Tang Seng said, his voice trembling with resolve. "We have to stop the screaming."
