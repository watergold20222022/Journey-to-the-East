# Journey to the East

A reimagining of the classic Chinese novel "Journey to the West" for contemporary United States readers.

## Overview

"Journey to the East" is a modern adaptation of the beloved 16th-century Chinese epic novel "Journey to the West" (西游记), one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. This reimagined work brings the timeless tale of adventure, spiritual growth, and friendship to a new audience while preserving the rich cultural elements and profound themes of the original.
